David , Chou .
Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk .
That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it .
I'll pick you up around 8: 00 .
It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration .
Here we are . This is Wangfujing Street .
Oh , sorry sir . We take no tips here . Thank you all the same .
No . Now would you like to help me look for the book ?
Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ?
The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite . I think that we should go look at it since we are here .
Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing .
No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn .

Oh , How annoying !

I've been great . What about you ?
You look very young .
All right . I'll take your words at that .
Yes , I was chosen as a Three Goods student many times in college .
I ' m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too .
That's great . We'll also need details of your occupation .
I feel it is OK and I want to give it a try .
What ? I thought you liked Patricia .
Don't mention it . That's what friends are for !

My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry .
Yeah , I just got one the other day .
Is she chubby ?
Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring .

Sure , when ?
A piece of cake ?
Seventy cents a piece .
What would you like to go with your steak ?
I found out when Jim's birthday is . It's this Friday .
We just weren't right for each other .
Yeah , the doctor said that I can leave soon . I really miss home .
No , you don't ! I should treat my new brother-in-law !
Apparently somebody took that book out of the library .
Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic .
I won't be paying you for this .
It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that .
Here you are . You'll find the sugar just over there .
To be honest , I ' m not , and I regret a little what I have done .
I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat .
The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak .
You don ' t look like enjoying this workout .
Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you .

Oh , I feel ok but I ' m still very tired .
I want some chocolate .

Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ?
Where is the house ?
I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up .
Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ?
I'm on the corner of the Fifth and Mane .
Sure , I would like a Coke .
Yes
Barbie is our best seller . She's only $ 29 . 95 .
Would you like to call home ?
Much better than the last one , huh ?
No , thanks . You ' Ve done a lot for me already . Thank you for everything .
Thanks a bunch .
We need you to urinate like you normally would , and then stop and finish into the cup .
I wonder if you could help me ?
No , never .
I always like to go for a walk before a supper .
But , ladies , the room ' s not yet ready . It will be delay about half an hour . Perhaps you can fill the registration form first . And rest at the lobby for a while . We ' ll let you know when the room ' s ready .
Ok , cool .
So what do I need to do ?
The Pyramids are amazing ! Millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ...
Did you go to school today ?
All right . I will get them for you .
What about your mother ?
Oh no .
Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent .
Why asking that ? It's often the sort of Dutch treat .
What are you talking about , we've tried everything !
And we ' ll all help you .
I can ' t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ' s it about ?
Are you sure you're finished ?
Cindy told me about you in our gym class .
Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ?
I study every night .
I think so . But can I try another one ? I don't like the color .
Yes , you are charged 50 cents a piece .
It is really early , isn't it ?
You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good !
Oh , yea . I forgot . So how did it go ?
Are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ?
How about tomorrow afternoon ?
Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ?
I want you in bed , right now , so sweet dreams .
IBA , Maria speaking . How can I help ?
I ' Ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head
R :: Mr . Aaron Johnson , phone number is 3242-5827 . Excuse me , how do you spell your first name ?
Would you please tell us how to review our lessons ?
I want to try on this pair .
I hope it hasn't left without me .
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
Never do that again .
They went to their stores to get one . Here they come with it now !
I'm sorry , but I don't think so .
Daddy , don't mention it .
Yes , I like it . I'm going to get it .
Over 2 million .
I'm tired of dancing .
I can be reached at my office during work hours and at home in the evening . My office phone number and home phone number are in my resume .
Yes , thank you . I am really far behind on this project . Could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ?
How will you pay , cash or charge ?
No , I'm afraid we'll have to cancel the order . I'm not sure whether it agrees with me .
Oh , don't mention it .
I heard they were just married for 5 months .
Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service . And some gas stations have both . But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve . You have to look at the signs .
The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk .
How about I get pizza and you get a burger ?
To be honest , I have no idea about these things ! But I'm sure that's alright .
Do you know which channel it is on ?
That's great . Will that be cash , check , or credit card ?
Yes . It depends . If you have a large order , we will give you a discount .
That comes to H . K . $ 120 .
This is going to take more time than I thought .
Not really . I'm expected to attend a meeting .
Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days .
Yes , is there something wrong ?
Shall we arrange a bail boy to pick up your luggage at nine o ' clock ?
I know , but I am really sick .
That's great . I'll tell my mother about it .
It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty .
This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on .
That sounds ideal .
I need a passport .
Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top .
That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only .
Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder .

We want to order 900 dozen .
I ' m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it .
How would you like to pay , Ms . Jones ?
No , I couldn't fall asleep last night .
Both my items will fit under the seat or in the overhead bin .
I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
Since I first met my wife , about three years .
What is this ? I didn't order that .
Hi . Is there anything I can do for you ?
Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
How's your work ?
Well , I've always used the Bank Book , but now I have this card . I don't know how to use it in the machine .
Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ?
That's great ! You need to prepare for it .
Yeah , that is what the holiday is for , isn't it ?
Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner .
Cool ! We can watch Ally Mcneal !
Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps .
What ' s the matter ? Didn ' t you sleep well last night ?
You're a light weight .
What are you doing ?
it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee
Yeah . I need to .
Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars .
Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive .
While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator .
Two .
Alright . Next time , we can try some other flavors .
Please fill in this application and sign your name down here , at the bottom .
My pleasure . ( It was my pleasure . )
I need about a pound of ground beef .
Do you want to take the jet ski ?
Excuse me , is this seat taken ?
Hello , Grace . That's a beautiful skirt you have on . Where are you going ?
There are two reasons for me to do it . First , I'm sure that there will be more opportunities for advancement If I enter your enterprise . Secondly , I'd like to acquaint myself with American culture if possible .
If you like Sons , then I'm sure you'll love Whole Foods .
Good idea . We should also get pedicures and manicures .
Certainly , it would be my pleasure , Mr . Smith .
My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas .
Do I have to change ?
Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ?
Be brave , young man . Only girls cry when given an injection .
I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes .
What kind of shoes ?
That would be twenty yuan , sir . We charge only by the number of hours , no split of each hour .
( They walk over to the apartment . ) As you can see , it's large and completely furnished .
just a few years ago . What about you ?
I guess I'd better go now .
Yes , and I have no idea how to do it .
The vegetables are kind of mushy .
Really , it's so beautiful .
I just transferred from another school .
I ' m glad to hear that .
Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy .
Well , he was very good to me . He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .
Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists .
I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .
I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation .
Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it .
That's exactly my understanding .
It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment .
You are going to work as my office secretary from next Monday . Right now I want to show you the rules of our company .
Not really , maybe we can just order some bread .
Do you have anything in particular that you would like our firm to take into account ?
I am . What ' s more , his wife is 84 .
OK , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card .
I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It's on sale , isn't it .
What's the make of your camera ?
Okay . For a party that size , we have a separate banquet room in the back .
Hi , my name is Violet . Come with me , and I'll help you wash your hair .
Not too bad , I suppose .
Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me !
Oh , yes . Erm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ?
It costs $ 65 to buy a monthly pass .
Hello , miss . Where is the button that controls my seat ?
Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ?
Hello ! Are you shopping here today ? Haven't I seen you in some flea markets and thrift shops a couple of times ?
Jim . I heard you got a promotion !
A big one would be nice .
OK . You can keep it as long as you need .
I grew up cooking . My mother shared her recipes with me .
I think I ' d like to just get another stereo , please .
Late in the afternoon , after work .
Hi there ! My name's Terry Graham . You're new around here , huh ?
Surely . As this is the latest model , and you can also set the alarm .
oh , sure . In British , students don ' t have to take the foundation course .
Sure ( They get on the boat ) .
I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired .
I'd like to have an ice cream
Mm . All my children hope to go to college . Right ?
Well , we come here almost every month .
Back to live with my parents . That ' s something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
Hey , Ray , what are you doing right now ?
Did you have anything specific in mind ?
What sort of western food do you like best ?
Could you tell me something about your previous job ?
We do not currently offer any retirement plan .
After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again .
Very well , thank you . And you ?
I'm studying medicine .
Alright . thanks .
It seems you got here at good time . Do you have a bus schedule ?
Yes , I'd like to know the exchange rate for yen .
I need to get one .
I ' d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force .
Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad .
Excuse me , Alex ?
Well , I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater . Why don't you join me ?
You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you .
I already did .
You bet it .
Will you please have the check certified ?
I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound .
Do you want to play poker ?
Do you know how late it is ?
Thank you for returning my call .
But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done .
Yes , what's your name ?
Oh , she ' s just fine . She ' s so grown up now .
well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it .
Mary , it was wrong of you to be so late . Mother ' s very worried .
So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much .
Well . I'm not everyone else's father . I think you need to be in the house by ten o'clock .
Carrie , I want to buy a pair of leather shoes to wear for the interview tomorrow .
Yes , you can use your cell phone during the boarding process until the aircraft door is closed .
So you will stay until 9th ?
If it were up to Tom , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ? He loves to sing .
Oh , I wouldn't worry about it .
I used your computer . And I ' m afraid I ' Ve erased your personal files accidentally .
And so I bought all these books on having kids and ...
I'm going to try sky diving this weekend .
Sorry , here .
I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings .
B :: Miao Eng ! I'd know that voice anywhere . What can I do for you ? Any problems ?
I would love the help ! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing ?
In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while .
Good to see you again , too . How ' s you family ?
Could you explain in detail ?
You see , but I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even two or three percent would help .
What kind of price did you want ?
well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too .
No . This time I'll try Chinese wine .
I'm grateful to you .
Congratulations ! How can you get such a good opportunity to be trained overseas ?
I realize that . We don ' t have any time to waste . I can put you down for 9:20 . Could you make that , Mr . Parker ?
What comes next ?
Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ' s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
No , there isn't , but there are some vegetables .
This problem has been happening for a few days now .
How much are you looking to rent it for ?
Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself .
What kind do you want to get ?
Salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job .
David , what have you been up to lately ?
You need at least $ 100 in your account .
I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it .
Do you have this model in white ?
Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
You're a quart low .
Actually , i could you some help . Thank you so much .
Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ?
Why don't you do your shopping at home ?
Do you want to watch it ?
You're welcome at any time .
Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress .
all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific .
Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD .
Cooke & Co . does a lot of placements in your field .
Have you been getting enough sleep lately ?
OK , I'll process that for you now .
Hi , Madam , I'm new here , could you tell me where is boarding gate ?
thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ' s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at .
Yes , I think so . Flight KL638 is still at the airport due to the hurricane .
If we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation .
People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
All right , then . Why don't we say next Tuesday at 11:30 a . m . ?
All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling .
I'm afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon .
What sort of experience do you have ?
Manchester United . What about you ?
Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured .
Don ' t you know it ' s rude to ask a lady her age ?
Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ?
Hi . John , it ' s Emily . How ' s everything ?
My present monthly salary is $ 1,500 .
I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page .
That's coincidence , someone's just returned two tickets and I picked them .
what do you have for breakfast ?
There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want .
Toronto is really a lovely place to visit .
thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ?
In that case , I won ' t keep you any longer . Drop in anytime .
But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail .
unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university .
Thank you . No . I ' m late for dinner at my house . I really have to go .
I suppose you ' re right , Lee . Maybe that ' s why so many Westerners are overweight .
I work in marketing . I'm a regional marketing manager for an IT company . Normally , I work out of Beijing , but I'm here on business . My friend Judy over there , she lives here and she invited me to this party . And you ? How about you ?
I ' ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along .
That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food .
I think so . I see it by the radio this morning .
To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ?
Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition .
My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores .
That doesn ' t make any sense .
Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I " m sure something can be worked out .
My pleasure , Sir . Bye .
This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect .
He is our accountant .
What finance experience makes you qualified for this position ?
500 US dollars .
Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere .
I'd be happy to write one for you .
Oh , no . On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall .
Nobody told me .
You heard who won the election , didn ' t you ?
OK . She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill .
I look like a nerd .
I'm almost done .
How do you sleep ?
That's a pity . How about Thursday ?
wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater .
Julia , I have good news for you .
Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow .
That's all right . What can I do ?
And would you like salad ? The salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives .
Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves .
Yes , could you put me in the non-smoking section ?
How far is it from the Wort Street ?
He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean !

I like to travel and I also like meeting various kinds of people .
I'm watching you .
Well , yes . I'll give him the medicine , too .
Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ?
Yeah , I've been working out a lot .
The remote control doesn't work . I turned on the television , but I can't change the channel .
It went off 30 minutes ago .
Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair .
Like who ?
Is this watch yours ?
Maybe you could have a look at this one .
OK , can I bring a date with me ?
What do you think are the main causes of war today ?
Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it .
Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me !
of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal .
Would you please wait this letter to see with the postages ?
How about some Oolong tea ? It's very popular with our guests .
I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here .
I suppose he won't come back until 6 p . m . By the way , do you want to call later , or would you like to leave a message ?
Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ?
Can I buy these tax free ?
I'm sorry to have bothered you .
Oh , I'm a little busy these days .
Ouch , that hurts -- did you have to mention her name ?
Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible .
Mary seems depressed . What ' s the matter ?
Don't forget to say " Thank you " when you take a seat .
I would rather buy them somewhere else .
We seem to be lost here .
Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate . Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year .
What should we do this Saturday ?
Well , I don ' t know .
John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ?
And what is the problem ?
You look really beautiful in it .
What kind of drink do you want with those meals ?
Oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert .
Very much . What time ?
Each month it'll cost $ 24 for a new sticker .
I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . The benefits are much better .
Yes , I can . To tell you the truth , I ' m the best nearby .
I forgot .
I think you're right . Thank you .
Do you have some questions ?
Tomorrow afternoon . Um ... When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ?
No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ?
Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ?
What happens on the holiday ?
Did you take a photo with her ?
posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice .
Because I ' m not in the mood , that ' s why .
Hi ! How are you doing ?
Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it .
Anytime .
Yes , you're on time . Are you often late ?
We'll be coming in tomorrow to make a rather large cash withdrawal , it's for payroll .

I've also brought some magazines for you . I hope they'll keep you from getting bored while you're in the hospital .
They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin . Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ?
I ' m sorry ? !
25 yuan , please .
You look upset , is there anything wrong ?
And no hijackers .
200 yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed .
I'm not really sure if it does or not .
You have to do it . But it takes only about 30 minutes .
there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me .
Well , are there any other advantages ?
A sack of cherries , please .
Who's she then ?
Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken .
By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses , I estimate that you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars .
Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ?
All right . Thank you very much .
Yeah ? Why ? Don ' t you like living with me ?
I know . But hard work pays off , you know .
What is your case against the police ?
It is a little more expensive , sir . But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate .
Who is it ?
I ... er ... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks .
Mary is really a diligent girl .
All right , sir . Please reconfirm your ticket no later than 12 noon two days before the flight ; otherwise , your reservation will automatically be canceled .
What were you writing ?
When will your wedding take place ?
Besides , don't make it too loose .
Other company rules also need your attention .
The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ?
But she took her luggage away with her .
Sure . Where shall I begin ?
I love your bracelet . When did you get it ?
Couldn ' t be better . And you ?
What's the matter , Paul ?
Sure . We have one on the second floor .
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator .

I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before .
Great . Let's go .
I guess so . I live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then .

He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader .
What kind of life do you prefer , city life or country life ?
I don ' t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird . It doesn ' t look natural .
Hey , Pat ! Yeah , I haven ' t seen you in ages ! How is going ?
I hope it won't be too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather .
Certainly . How much will you be exchanging today ?
Whose part do you think is best played ?
Not that I know of . Why do you ask ?
I was laughing through the whole movie .
Certainly . It ' s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year .
What's the problem ? We really can't have any delays at this stage . We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget .
Come on ! Three's a crowd !

You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French .
Now I came back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend , the pen is broken , I am afraid .
It costs only 25 yuan .
OK , you ' ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time .
He ' s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .
I have never done that myself . But I hear it is very interesting . You two should go .
There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days .
Yes , I have . I was employed by the financial section of the university ever since I graduated . I worked there for 3 years . Then I had worked in a bank for 3 years .
I will try my best .
With an ocean view ?
Half the dough huh . Well . How would you like to earn the other half ?

Yes , we are . Could we have the check , please ?
No ! It's a perfect fit !
Ok . Here's my passport .
Nothing unusual , I ' m afraid .
Hi , I was wondering if you have my test results in .
I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this .
Well , have a good day off from class .
Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
I've heard about that , but I've never tried it .
Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number .
Thanks , I will appreciate it . How long have you been here ?
I am calling to let you know that you are expected to come for an interview in our branch .
OK . Well , to dial to the outside you just now dial the number . For a call inside the company just hit the extension number . Do you know the extensions ?
Is that room service ?
But the freight cost will be higher and that will affect the retail price .
What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ?
Good evening , sir . Are you ready to order now ?

I suppose my strong point is that I like developing new things and ideas .
May I inquire about the departure time ?
Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere .
But you can see the key in his hand through the window !
I will get better soon .
I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills .
How are you doing , Christopher ?
No problem . What size would you like ?
You must be joking . Those two .
I understand that he ' s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ' t be very good .
Enjoy your stay .
And do you have friend there ?
I'm calling to confirm your booking .
Not so well . I've come down with the flu .
No extra charge at all . But your berth will be invalid .

You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful .
I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
Is this OK ?

That would be great . Thanks !
Yes . But I will not take much cash with me I can ask the bank to give me the traveler's checks . So it will be safer .
Yeah , What happened ?
And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum . Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .
That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section .
Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning .
How about these ? They are the current bestsellers .

You mean used car ?
It all sounds very complicated .
Where is my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet !
Give me your email , would you ?

I guess we'll either make it , or we won't .

Morning , Mum !
nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable , I think I could fall asleep !
First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum .

You are waltzing quite wonderfully . It's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
Yes , it is . It ' s wonderful after the downpour .
And do you feel anything when I do this ?
No , that ' s not true . Many adults like the Harry potter books too .

Well , you don ' t have to be mean . How do I do it ?
The usual place . In front of the treasure house .
Does he like that country ?
As a rule , we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant L / C . It takes longer , of course , for special orders . In no case would it take longer than six months .
Let me check . It's 3 . 80 m .
Certainly , what day were you thinking of ?
That means Month / Day / Year . Use numbers .
Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history .

Here is ten dollars .
Depending on what you consider a lot .
Does it cost to use it ?

I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray .
Can we talk about the working overtime issue ? What ' s on your mind ?

I have studied English , tourist culture , guiding methods and techniques and so on .
Isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ?
I'm afraid you can't today .
Hand me some globes and paper flowers , I'll put them on these top branches .
When would you want to leave ?
I ' m afraid there isn ' t . My boss only pays lip service .
Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?
You ' d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ' d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ' d be the first to buy your posters and I ' d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography .
For one month . If you can ' t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer .

Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors ?

I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains .
I appreciate the effort , sir .
Yes , will this do ?
I can ' t do that .
Yes . I worked in a small machinery factory . My work was very simple and there was not much work to do .

She doesn't appear to be headed this way , so I will go get the check .
yes , but with our sense we'll always look good .
Yes we are going towards Westminster Abbey . I can see it now ! Look to your right .

Would you love to introduce me to her ?

Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ?
You know she probably feels just as bad .
Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ?
I wouldn't mind a burger .
Don ' t buy him underwear again . He hates that .
What's the problem ?
I stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
I think dimes and quarters will do .
I like collecting antiques . It's expensive , but it's a lot of fun .
Women love roses , so your wife will be very happy .
We need to get food ?
It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom .
Then , you put S in this blank .
Unique , aren ' t they ? I bet you ' Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ' s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .
An all-day pass is 30 dollars for adults and 20 for children .
Is there any furniture in it ?
Let me check . Yes , we can .
How do I take the sucking lozenges ?
ok . Just call me if you need anything then .
Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ?
There's a car waiting for you just outside the door . Right this way , please .
I ' m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears .
Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge .
Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world .
Wow . That sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and powder . Could you ring those up for me along with the lipstick ?
I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ?
Good morning , Mr . Zhang , this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company .
I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work .
I guess I can do that .
I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ?
Oh , I'm sorry , but I've just accepted another offer that I feel is more suitable to my needs .
What's special about Melbourne Zoo ?
Ah , thanks .
Would you please fill in this registration form ?
Hey Joe , how have you been ?
OK , thank you .
Do you think you are the right candidate for this position ?
It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time .
Who are those kids walking down the aisle ?
Are you serious ? We ' Ve been friends for years ! We can ' t just change that overnight !
What do you want to do tomorrow night ?
That's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules .
That's right . This entrance is for even numbers . That entrance over there is for odd numbers . Let's go over there .
How do you feel about this restaurant ?
There we go . Thanks very much .
OK , I will send someone to see you off .
I think that I have something else really important to do on that day . I just can ' t remember what it is .
Excuse me , my skin is always dry , can you give me some advice ?
You can take me there ?
I am disappointed with your work lately .
I need to find a new way of getting my insurance .
Yes , I did , but I didn ' t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that .
But , you work with her everyday .
What are you talking about ? It wasn ' t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !
Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil .
Right here ! It hurts right here !
It's my pleasure . We hope you'll visit Beijing again .
Yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats .
By weight . 6 . 0 cents per pound .
Not really , I like watching horror movies , like ' The Unborn . '
It ' s Saturday , a great weekend .
That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself . You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more . If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars .
I hope you can try to get them to step up production .
Not at all . Turn left out of the hotel and it's about a five minute walk .
True , but I still have to watch my baseball . The season's in full swing now .
It was bought on November 12th at 3
Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study two hours a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ?
Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !
Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences .
Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ?
Now have you ever thought of going by express bus ?
I see . Where do I have to change them ?
Have you heard about Anlesen David ?
By this time , it's better . The rush hour is over .
I don't think it's realistic . I thought it was sick . Why does a movie have to use that kind of humor ?
Let me try . It has to be somewhere amazing , and far away ... Egypt ?
I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you .
I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to .
No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot .
Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ?
You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith .
Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter .
Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ?
Yes , it is . How many pieces of hand luggage do you have ?
To the Municipal Government Hall .
of course if I can .
We demand a surcharge of 80 cents for it .
First of all , as far as I know , your company has had impressive records in business . Second , I want to enter the foreign trade field .
Well , I need the display monitor . But Tom can set that up for me on Wednesday . I will need you to help with everything else .
Do you have any publications ?
How much is the ticket ?
when did you take your exams ?
Joe , how are you doing ?
You're got a point there . But do you think he's a little absent-minded ?
Oh , that's interesting !
that's pretty harsh .
Then you would like the ' no frills ' business account .
I guess I never thought of that before .
OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ?
Now let's begin the class . Who is on duty today ?
No , I haven ' t gotten over there in a few weeks . How is he ?
If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs .
I went to Paris .
Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch .
I am really tired of Terry .
But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period .
do you like cooking , Julia ?
I've just been working a lot .
Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me !
Well , sir , we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant .
You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account .
It was my pleasure .
How have they decided to deal with that ?
Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit .
Pay it off , and they'll clear your record .
Hi Linda , this is Todd .
Both , doctor . I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five .
They sure are . They are practically jumping in the boat .
Great . Thank you very much .
Well , I understand how you feel , and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly , just in case it's still in there . If she finds it , we will all be happy . If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ' s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so .
I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it .
Love Music Woman
Tomato , orange and apple juice , please .
That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .
Well ... How about Friday then ?
That's a bit more than I was prepared to pay .
We serve different styles of Chinese food here . But I'm not sure which one do you prefer .
Betty , something is burning . Can you smell it ?
ok . What's your number ?
that's exactly what the visa officers want to hear . Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board ?
Is she old or young ?
Mind your own business .
Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ' s 400m relay .
I'm not very sure . but I know ruby is less valuable than diamond .
How will I know what the results mean on the website ?
what seems to be the problem ?
I ' m fabulous .
Your prices seem a little high .
Ok , when and where did you last see it ?
I like beer , it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3 .
Yeah , I agree . It makes you feel really good .
Ok , see you 10 o'clock next Monday !
What other forms will I need to turn in ?
Yes ! Let ' s go sailing and water skiing . That ' s so exciting .
I ' d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ?
As you know I serve as a secretary in my present company , I really want to look for a more challenging opportunity .
I have the abilities , qualities and experience that you requested in your job advert , for example I have three years experience in designing products and I got leadership experience while serving the college student union as president .
To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ?
I really can't say how long she'll be .
Take care .
According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups .
Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ?
It ' s going all right . I ' m learning some things for the first time , but I ' m also brushing up on some things that I already know .
Yes , I have , I tried once when I visited your country last year , I think they were very tasty . Can you cook them ?
It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .
Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep .
What changes were made from the old page to the new page ?
Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ' t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ' s the end of this company !
I want to buy one to match my shirt . Can you give me some advice ?
Thank you . Do I have to pay in advance ?
Hi . How can I help you ?
You know that I only allow one absence per semester , don't you ?
How much is the membership fee ?
Do I have to travel a lot ?
Instead of walking you can take this shuttle to get you there faster .
I can play drums , but I haven ' t played for a while . I ' m not sure I ' d be good enough to play in a band .
Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together .
I hear you're entering the speech contest , Mike .
Yes , it is . Conrad is gay . Didn't you know ?
Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid .
What are you going to be doing ?
You are always so naughty .
I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up .
You are something else you know that ?
I'm not feeling too well . I've caught a cold .
Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it . First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ' Ve put them all in the sink and there is a peeler .
I don't blame you , sir . Two dollars is a lot of money .
Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to .
When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought .
( 5 minutes later ) What sort of hairstyles do you like ?
I'm looking forward to our son's graduation this weekend .
Me too . If we don ' t do something soon , It might be too late .
Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize .
Who cares ? She is pretty .
This is Room 603 . I'm afraid that the heating system doesn't work . It's very cold here .
People are funny .
OK , I will have to take some details from you . Could you tell me your name , please ?
I dare you to talk to that girl .
Unscrew the burnt fuses and replace them with the good ones . You can find them on the rack in the basement .
You mean your sister ?
Go ahead .
What do you want me to do about it ?
What , your short already , sir .
Don't you know that he has been carrying a torch for Mary for years ?
Don ' t worry . That ' s just a part of being a teenager .
Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ?
Oh , wait a minute . What about a lid for the pan ?
Baby , I love you so much .
OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ...
Could you drop us off on that corner ?
What a large child !
Well , too bad . So , what foreign film won an Oscar in 1993 ?
Would you please get the bill ready before supper ?
Mary , today is a great day for you .
well , last night I had a big argument with Ann .
Sorry , the connection is terrible . I'll call you back because I can't hear anything .
I'm afraid you can't .
Then why don ' t we go for a walk in the hills . It ' d be very good for us you know .
I don't mind walking .
Is it ? I had no idea it was so late . I must be off now .
Please meet him now .
so where did you land ?
Are you serious ? How can that be ?
Hi , Mr . James , what ' s the rush ?
That's why I promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week .
What ? Then what did you do ?
How many persons are there in your family ?
thank you for help . good bye .
Do you think children watch too much Tv ?

The boss is planning to sell the company .
Then make an appointment by telephone and wait for the interview .
Yes , you get off at the square .
Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown .
Well , today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count .
Twenties would be fine .
Are you sure ? We can't really take it ? I reconfirmed with Miss Peterson the other day .
No , really . I'm not in the mood for it .
Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ?
So you are interested in our company .
School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now .
That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?
Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad .
Listen to this . Mary got married .
Most models only eat once a day . If they can do it , so can we .
Oh , I am sorry . I ' m afraid I can ' t do it now . I have to meet my supervisor in a few seconds . But I could mail it after that .
Yes , there are 62 in totals , and 2 of them still can't be sure .
Well , there ' s nothing we can ' t handle . I ' ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it . Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
The wine choices are posted on the little menu in the middle of the table .
Heineken and Budweiser . We have a two-for-one happy hour special .
No problem , sir .
I think I like classical music better .

Even if an item is on sale ?
Without is fine .
OK , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits .
This building is only four years old . It was built with central air .
isn ' t it really cold there ?
I ' Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ' t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .
The question is easy for everybody . Don ' t you think so ?
I will try . My apologies .
I know that you are interested in our washers .
Yes . Do you have any specials today ?
Hello . May I help you ?
your muscles are a spectacle !
There will be about 18 people .
Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ?
Is that Phoenix time ?
You can find the most fashionable restaurants there . And also you can see the galleries , antique shops and the ballrooms .
What would you say was the lowest point in your life ?
Sure . This is the one I will not hesitate to recommend . Its color and style is so attractive and also the quality is really reliable .
I'm afraid it is . So you will have to pay two yuan extra . The total charge is four yuan .
I want to think of it for some time .
That sounds interesting .
Okay , now I ' d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ?
I'd love to try it . but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice .
You can say you have had a firm grasp of the professional knowledge , and you can communicate with others proficiently in English .
Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .
Let me have a look . I think the batteries should be changed . Let me replace them with new ones . Now , it's working .
Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ?
Yes , I heard the lights were out all night .
I'm sorry , but everything is taken .
Oh , this feels very nice . It's perfect . I'll take it .
Does that mean you ' re not going to take the train to work anymore ?
Oh , do you want to play sometime ?
Hi , Jason . It ' s Elizabeth Montgomery . Have you got those plans drawn up yet ?
Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ' ll show you around .

Well , what brings you here ?
The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training .
All right , madam . For which dates do you want to book the rooms ?
It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy !
So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ?
That was a cake walk . It ' s nothing to speak of .
That's the last time I'm trusting you with the transportation .
Are you going anywhere for your vacation ?
Hi , can I help you ?
How's your mother doing ?
Is there a problem , officer ?
Do you have much experience with kids ?
Let me see your passport , please .
No , I don't know which one to choose . I think maybe you can help me .
Yes , I ' m feeling very well these days .
Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan .

I think so . One minute I feel quite awake , and the next I feel very tired .
Where to , sir ?
I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
What's your name ?
When did you learn to dance ?
I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here .
That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ?
Is it difficult to learn ?
I started at PCC .
When are you coming back ?
Yes . I was awarded a scholarship from the university every year . In 1995 I participated in the National Contest of Maths Models and I won the prize .
You already ate .
Just a sec I ' m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast .
Well , some money of course , a vise , all my identity cards and some photos .
Hello . I'm Jason .
Around 20 minutes , but it all depends on the traffic .
Fine . we we'll send it to you right now .
How long does it take ?
You can ask Frank and Cathy to help you .
sounds great . see you then .
Sorry , you can only pay cash .
Where do you need to catch this bus at ?
Go and get it repaired .
yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great .
Can you accept a check ?
There ' s nobody here by that name .
It's sounds like fun .
The brakes don't really work that well anymore either .
Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well .
Yes , she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience .
I'd love to . What date is it ?
Yes , I ' m a singer .
I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems .
He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark .
So beat the cat , but don't kill it .
Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break .
Okay . Let's see . . . a size 36 dark brown leather belt . Oh , yes . Her e we are . Do you think your husband will like this one ?
Just word of mouth .
How about your one-year-old baby ?
Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening !
Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening .
A movie sounds good .
I've always got room for something sweet !
Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped )
Hello , Mr . Jones , its ...
I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ?
Yes , I think you'll be very satisfied with that one .
This situation isn't easy to handle .
We need to do a group report tomorrow . I need to go to the stationer to buy something for the posters .
They want you to pick up the cost of the home inspection , but they accepted your offer .
I'll just have this all wrapped up for you .
No , sir . So far it is the least expensive suite for tomorrow night .
Yes . I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angeles on Sep . 19th .
I am on my way to the doctor now , but I should be back in about 45 minutes . Can I come back at around 3:15 ?
Monica , wait a moment . I think we ' d better call the repair man to do it .
How about this one ? It's the special local product .
Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date .
Alright everyone settle down . Let ' s get started . As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?
That'll be eighty-five cents .
I'll have to ask my wife how long she'll need it for as it is mainly for her belongings . I'll come back after we have discussed it . Thanks for your help .
Where are you from , Laura ?
Please come in , Steven .
Yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ?
Yes , I had a look just now , I feel we can do a lot of business in this line .
Not at all .
Yes , I ' m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump .
Man , I ' m freaking out ! You gotta help me !
Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ?
If you have any problems , just call us .
Thank you so much , I would really appreciate that .
He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !
Really ? Are you willing to recommend me for the position ?
I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ?
What a nice day !
Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job ?
Is this your first time visiting Beijing ?
How about the end of this month ?
Did you get a nice tree ?
It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early .
Is there a Post Office sign on the building ?
Serious ? Only the proof of my address .
We ' re just going door to door .
I started washing here about three years ago .
Hello , this is my claim tag . Can I get my baggage ?
Really ? I can ' t believe you actually found an apartment in the ads .
So Jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg .
If you give me your credit card , I can take care of it for you .
It looks good on you .
I ' d like to set a fixed time for this meeting before we finish today . Can you all take a look at your schedules ?
It is said that the Cowherd and the Spinster , the lover stars in heaven , can only meet on the seventh Eve , so this day has become the Lover's Day .
Thank you for telling me .
What is there in the air ?
But we have to work tomorrow .
Sure , where are you ?
I was missing you too .
You can ' t be serious !
You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ?
That's right . Here you go .
Have you taken any medicine ?
I promise .
We will definitely be getting another .

How about tango ?
All right , I see what you mean .
Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ?
Oh , so am I .
I can send that information to you .
That sounds good . How much is one ?
Yeah , it ' s a couple weeks away , and we don ' t have anything yet .
Yeah right ! I ' m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ' s really not healthy !
Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?
That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line .
Yeah , I ' m with you on that .
You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ?
Really ? In that case , could I have the number of the Service Centre please ?
What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you .
Do you have the latest lipstick from Christian Dior ?

I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ?
Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car .
Do you want to know something about the American character ?
I think we have . Is there anything else to discuss ?
Mmm ... it is delicious .
I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile .
Right , and what about our friendliness and attitude ?
Excuse me , I don't feel good right now .
I'm a real man , and I like football .
Didn't you get the memo ?
I really want to be far away from the reality now .
Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight !
Where did you get that idea ?
I was hoping to talk to you today about your business .
Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week .
Good morning ! I am a rookie in our office .
Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it .
Yes , madam . I graduated from Tianjin College of Finance and Trade three years ago .
I think so , too . Our only request is that the quality is in conformity with the contract stipulations .
A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
Who's coming ?
Here we are on the train .
Only 3 % ? That's not much . If you could make some concessions , we would probably buy some of your other products .
Oh , my CV . Yes , here it s . There are three copies .
What does the contact information include ?
Here you are , madam . All these are sixteens .
Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs .

What do you mean , Mr . Smith ? You said to make it brief .
Have you decided on anything ?
Well , you have three hearts -- lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date !

Sure . That would be great .
Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ?
That ' s exactly what they did .
Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
What is the telephone number there ?
I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions .
Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in .

Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ?
Okay . This will be charged to your amenities account , okay ?
What store do you shop at ?
Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
That's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one .
It should have been , but it wasn ' t .
Bob , what are you thinking about ?
Wait a moment , please . Oh , yes , Steven Smith . It's for a single room with a bath . Is that right ?
It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How have you been ?
We needed larger premises so we moved to this greenfield site last year . It's nearer the motorway so it's better for transportation .

Well , I , umm , I flushed it ...

What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ' t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet .
Thank you . Bye-bye !
I need some US Dollars .
How is everything ?
How ' s your trip going ?
I have just got lost with my friends . Would you please help me find them ?
Like that Rastafarian over there ? You mean dreadlocks ? You crazy ! That'll take way too long .

You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up .

I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ?
Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ...

That's fine with me . I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time .

Of course I did !
Yes . of course . I turned it on half an hour ago . I don't think it work at all .
We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % .
OK , will do !
All right , then . Why don ' t we say next Tuesday at 11:30 a . m . ?
Wow . You must have been pretty far away from the city .
I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ?
I'll be right back .
go ahead .
Sixty dollars .
I notice there's a jam a few blocks away .
Which sports are popular in your country ?
A little bit expensive , but I will buy one . This is $ 25 , here you are .
Let's just get both . Do you bring enough money ?
So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ?
That works for me !
You want to go get a facial with me today ?
I am applying for the waiter in your pub .
Actually , I have to go to school right now .
OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ?
Yes . You should rent a brown suit and a black shirt .
Sure . You can go to the front desk to ask for more help .
Pardon ? The line is bad . Don ' t hang up please . I ' ll have the call transferred to another line .
Please told Tim to close the door to the basement . I don ' t want dog down there tonight .
Sounds great
Of course sir , no problem .
Okay , let me know when you're ready to order your food .
Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food .
How's that ?
Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic .
Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir . What exactly is problem ?
Oh I see . So that ' s why you didn ' t come in ?
Pure gold ones , please .
Did you like the play ?
Yes , I ' m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too .
Can I pay by credit card ?
Oh , I almost forgot . It's my mum's birthday Saturday . I need to get her some more Chanel . Could you get me the 1 . 7 ounce bottle of Chanel cologne ?
It's my pleasure .
Me too . I am looking forward to cooperating with you again .
Here you go , honey , fried eggs .
Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have trying my best to be a good employee .
And you don't feel any pain anywhere else ? In you legs , for example ?
ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ?
When is the next train to Shanghai ?
On the contrary , very exciting .
What characteristics should an interpreter own ?
I ' m going to work .
My father ' s angry face always makes my blood run cold .
Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer .
I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .
I ' Ve prepared most of it already and we ' Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know , crisps , biscuits , and things . Are you going to make the punch ?
Me too . I can't wait until winter .
Steve . Is that you ?
Mr . Martin , we're on arrival .
how was your day ?
Excuse me , waiter . I have just dropped the spoon onto the ground . Would you please bring me another one ?
I know . Maybe we can finish it tomorrow .
thanks , that was nice of you .
I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning .
What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ' s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap !
Hello ?
Why do they serve up the noodles first ? I don't like it . Where is the cake ?
In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver .
Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well .
Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs .
Are there any potatoes ?
I help out at the children's hospital . I help plan activities .
I'm really glad that you came to see me .
Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place .
Let's meet half way , 20 yuan , OK ?
There are many services you can choose from . Why don't you take a look at this leaflet while I find someone who can help you ?
Are you studying here ?
Were there any injuries ?
Yes , I intend to go to university . That ' ll be in September . But it all depends on my A level results .
it can't be that bad .
Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
Excuse me , do the buses stop here ?
Here ' s 30 yuan .
Well , when you hear it change , that means you have an outside line . Where are you trying to call ?
We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this .
What happened ? You look so pale .
That would be a lot of help .
That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?
Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer ?
Fine . Here is your room key , here is also a map of our hotel . The swimming pool , gym and sauna are all located on first floor .
Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?
I am in Room 205 . My name is Bill Smith . When shall I check out ?
Thank you . Do you need something else ?
Don't worry about it . Just leave it to the insurance companies .
I have to support my parents who are advanced in age , so I'd like to commence at HAD 2,500 a month .
Excuse me , I'm afraid you've parked in the wrong spot .
But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun .
Hi B . How are you ?
I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in .
Hi Henry . How are you ? Is everything Okay in your apartment ?
Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ...
Give me your hand . ( takes Rose's hand ) Close your eyes . Go on . ( Rose closes her eyes ) Step up . Now hold on to the rail . Keep your eyes closed ; don't peek .
OK , I will . Thank you .
Almost . Let me get my bag .
What do they need all that money for ?
We ' re getting donations for the campaigns .
It's my pleasure . We have single rooms , double rooms , suites and luxury suites , ect . Well , here is an introduction to our hotel .
Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .
No , I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo .
Well . Miss Sun , as you know , we are looking for an executive secretary with good English skills and some business background . We looked over your resume and thought you might be a good candidate .
Yes , I am young , and unmarried . It's no problem for me to travel frequently .
But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body .
Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort .
Is there any other place you would like me to go to for you ?
Could I ask you for a favor ? My laser printer is out of ink and I need to print out something urgent . If you don ' t mind , I would like to send you these files . Could you then print these for me ?
Can you help me , please ?
I would like the two clothes washed .
I'm okay with walking .
Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee do you want to have ?
Chocolates .
No , but we still stay in touch .
Is the seed edible ?
You mean there is really not that much of a difference .
Sure . I'm J McQuillin and my number is 323-555-6840 , extension 42 .
Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases .
It's $ 25 .
Umm hmm . Do you have a diver's license ?
Yes , but we charge 50 % more and it only takes 3 hours .
I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ?
Oh , it's ten o'clock . I'd better go now .
I didn ' t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out .
Sir , according to your file , you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic . '
Then what is the problem , sir ?
I heard about that . It was successful .
It says ' Wet paint ! '
Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband .
By airmail please .
No . It doesn ' t . There ' s no through bus to the national history museum Madam ..
Go ahead , please .
He ' s a postman .
What are you talking about ?
I would like to book a table for seven thirty o'clock , please .
Let ' s go for a joy ride .
Excuse me . sir . Can I have look at the timetable please ?
What appliances ?
I've already got it . Thanks .
I wasn't aware that I had to go to court .
Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ?
He ' s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that .
Ow !
I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales .
Today's interview is for us to get to know a little about you . If needed , there will be a more lengthy interview later . So , if you ' re comfortable , let's begin .
No , I usually have to stand .
150 a month .
May I have two tickets for Tiny Times ?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
Today .
Thanks , it hasn ' t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters .
I played the video game at Mike's home yesterday .
Your dream will come true . It's really breathtaking
PCs often crash from virus , but it's nearly impossible to get a virus from a Mac .
Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
What can you expect with this crowd ? I am praying that no one will cut in the line .
Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ?
Isn't it a Sunday ?
Our company now has n ombudsman ?
I'm with you , Jane .
I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ?
I cut it on that blade .
Ow ! Don ' t shout so loud . Calm down . Please stop shouting and sit quietly down .
My name is David White .
It's already reduced 20 % .
I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan .
my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England .
This is the right place . Please join us .
If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws !
Fine , what do you call this ?
It's so nice of you .
You don't have to . This is your knob menu . Just tick off the items you want for breakfast . write down the time and hang it outside the door before you go to bed tonight .
Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ?
It seems too short .
Thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ?
That's strange .
Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city .
Size 36 . . . I think .
Are you kidding ? It's too early for her .
Do you like your margarita with salt or no salt ?
Please put one under your tongue , do not swallow it .
At seven , please .
How much is it ?
Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow .
I will get it soon .
Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I ' m also in the process of writing my first novel .
Yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ?
It's about a ten-minute walk .
My mom is three years older than my dad , and they are like night and day . My mom is 5 footsweet and very nice , and very caring , and very cute , everybody tells her how young she looks , and how she resembles my sister , perhaps . My father is very much completely opposite that . He is a very bi 4 , on a good day , 5 foot 2 , I think in real life , and she is very nice .
Today ?
I put in two quarters for a coke , but nothing came out of the machine .
Check out , sir ?
You should save in case of an emergency , you need to have more self-control , what things did you spend money on ?
I really just have two problems with this .
If you buy 1,000 or more , you'll get a 10 % discount .
Did you remember to lock your door before you left then ?
Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ?
In that case , just tell me your phone number .
Where's my pencil ?
How are you doing ?
Really ? Where ?
Good-bye !
Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ?
He is afraid of his father-in-law .
Yes , it deserves its name .
And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3 . 50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 .
Yeah , you . I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there .
It's worth the time .
My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution .
I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ' t tell me .
All I can tell you is our next President got my vote .
Did he actually say that ?
Oh ! I just want to drop in on him for a chat .
We'd better see if he is ok .
Keep in touch .
I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me !
Is there a package with basic and movie channels ?
Tell us about some cold cities .
How old is he now ?
Your luggage is over 8 kilograms .
How much money would you like to withdraw ?
Wow , this thing can haul .
Ok , I will take two bottles .
I see . Will you walk this way , please ? What experience have you had ?
Then what ?
Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ?
Thank you . Goodbye .
I see . I'd better never try .
How long have you been feeling like this ?
May I have a look at your room card , Mr . Black ?
No , I don't like the brown one .
You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? !
Well , we won't be able to guarantee you a room for February 22 , but we can book you on February 23 . Is that OK ?
Well , it's not the supermarket you want .
If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .
I'm afraid not , but can you make it Thursday afternoon ?
There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on .
No , sir , I am serious . Haven't you heard that today men are becoming increasingly interested in having their eyebrows professionally groomed ?
Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ?
Hello , Bobby , It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock .
Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours .
I said I had been to the doctor the day before .
Can I have a look at your ticket ?
Here comes the bus . I'll ring you up later .
Salesman ?
Thank you for meeting me here .
Do you know which direction it should be heading ?
I ' d like to wish you every success in your new venture .
that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home .
Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .
So you may like inventive jobs .
Well , thanks for asking for my permission ... Now hand it over and let me record !
Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ?
For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions .
Sure , what's up ?
Right now fight BW159 is the only one available , it is a non-direct one .
Does that mean studying all the time ?
Isn ' t it on the bookshelf ?
8 it is . See you then .
I need help . I think my arm is broken .
I'm Robert , at your service .
That ' s true . But Americans work hard for their money like we do . I don ' t know why our spending habits are so different .
I know , but I want to make reservations this week .
Really ? How did it go ?
We can work something out .
Hello . Smith ' s Resident .
Good . Can you please also list all the documents in those old files ?
Hi . Ed , what's up ?
It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier .
no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while .
Oh I see . So what did you do then ?
Here , sir . Sit down in this wheel chair .
Would you , please ? Thank you .
we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great .
We also have to vacuum the house .
They describe how each process goes on to the next .
Will you bring our bill , please ?
Business couldn't be better .
I think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with this sweater ?
No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ' t even pay for Drin
We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan .
OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ?
Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?
I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing .
All in all , it will never lose its appeal .
Yes it is down there , at the end of the road , next to the supermarket .
Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ?
Put all baggage on the conveyor belt . Walk through the detector gate one at a time , please .
Ah , well , we have no choice .
Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ' ll never hit the road . After all , he ' s got it made in the shade here .
Don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together .
Thanks for your help .
Yes , I'm sure you do . It sounds like an excellent service .
No , thanks . I'm good .
I see . May I have your name and room number , please ?
Whom would you like to talk to ?
A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
Yes , that ' s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this .
That's terrific . Thank you .
Joe ? I don't know what you mean .
Well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages !
Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work .
What ? You ' re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago .
We went out to the stadium . Bob hadn ' t been to a game for a few weeks .
The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance .
Are you an American ?
Just a minute . Here's your change .
Well , between $ 350-400 a month .
Ok , great , should I bring anything ?
Oh !
I think the plans look good . There's just one thing though , I'm a bit concerned about the main lorry entrance . What's the height clearance ?
A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi .
That's pretty much the same as I've been quoted at other banks .
That must be a very interesting job .
You can check out two books at a time .
Oh dear . Well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future .
You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends .
I think it ' s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ' t you agree ?
All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal .
I ' m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ' t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing .
Yes , I've paid all of them off .
Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too . Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .
Do you have anything made in the 1920s ?
Absolutely . Who were you playing with ?
How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account .
No , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . How about you ?
Shall I just trim it ?
May I take your order now , sir ?
I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so .
In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . The streets are often icing in the morning . With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
Let ' s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here !
As a matter of fact , I am .
Yeah . And I never want to go again .
fine , thanks . How are you ?
You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more , otherwise , you can ' t find a job .
That's $ 38 , sir .
They have the freshest foods there .
That's sheer robbery !
Do you take vitamin pills regularly ?
I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .
That ' s horrible .
For three bottles of Tsingtao beer .
I don't blame her . I really enjoyed it there when we went a few years ago . I'd like to go back sometime soon .
Here you go -- Digital Barbie .
It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves .
Yes . Let ' s sleep on the sand . That ' s most exciting !
I can bet the farm that you will regret about your decision . You cannot find a better one .
Can I help you , sir ?
We have a really interesting project coming up . Would you want to join us on it ?
How could the news get any worse ?
Never mind , dear .
We've had a few problems . One of the bolts has worked loose and a blade has snapped off .
You mean half-and-half ?
Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ?
It should be 3
Do you want me to fill it out now ?
Wow ! I didn't notice the time . It ' s almost noon . I have to get home .
It ' s going to be $ 25 .
When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep .
Yes , speaking . Can I help you ?
Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ?
This is going to be my first time voting .
Vince . We're both busy , so I'm not going to beat around the bush . I need a raise .
Throughout the interview you should maintain patience .
I was thinking about seeing a movie .
512 .
I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ?
No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time .
Oh , I almost forgot . Thank you for calling to remind me . Actually . I do need to change the time of my appointment . I have a scheduling conflict . And I can't make it that early .
Don ' t sweat it . We will land safely .
I trust you . We'll be happy .
Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint .
I'd prefer swordfish steak .
What's your favorite book ?
What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ?
Right now I ' m basically just a secretary , but if I ' m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there .
How was your game today ?
That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter .
Not much . Joann . Do you want to hang out ?
Well , what do you want to see ? I don't think there are many good movies out right now .
I've been overseas , So have you been busy lately ?
How about this one ? It ' s the latest design , simple but elegant .
Sure , let ' s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original .
Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time .
Come over and chew the fat . We can enjoy to our hearts'content .
That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ?
That ' s my problem . I don ' t have a lot of options .
In cash .
All I had was a sandwich , chips , and soda .
Health insurance company and policy number ?
That's 1,825 dollars .
Yes , but the results are not so satisfying .
Double P for Papa ?
Oh , I ' m sorry . I forgot about those completely . I ' ll bring them by your office .
Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ?
I'd like to see a tea set , please ?
You'll soon get accustomed to it . It ' s not difficult . Well , here's the bus . Fortunately , it's not full .
Do you now the temperature today ?
Yes , he is familiar with the plan .
Charge it to whatever account you like .
Mr . Smith , I'm wondering whether you have found a way of considering my offer ?
I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price .
Where's Tom this evening ?
I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last .
Thank you . Anything else ?
Thanks , I ' ll ask him .
Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ?
We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green .
I'm afraid it gains a little .
No , I wasn't . It's kind of hard to watch the road when Joseph is behind the wheel .
What's wrong with it ?
I'm sorry . It ' s out of season now .
You've come to the right place . We've got various styles and sizes recently . How much do you measure around your waist ?
What salary are you expecting ?
I ' ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ?
What do you eat ?
Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap .
Happy New Year , Jim !
Your doctor has requested a urine sample .
Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents .
I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?
Are you a transfer passenger , sir ?
Have you ever been to Xi ' an ?
What kind ?
Oh , thank you . I want one .
It's 500 dollars .
I ' d rather you didn ' t come immediately as I said I ' m very busy at the moment . Come after lunch , Mark .
a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ?
We boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem .
What a pity ! How about tomorrow evening ?
Yes , we do . How can I help ? I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ?
I'll take it . Please set the watch for me .
Let's click to check it out .
What's the brand ?
My internet is having problems connecting .
Yes , he is . He ' s very hardworking when he ' s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends .
Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful !
Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry .
Then I ' ll just use my credit card .
A match made in heaven .
Sure . Please wait for a moment .
How did you get involved in something like that ?
but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss .
Young man , tell me everything you ate yesterday evening .
It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful .
Is there anything I can do to help you ?
I got it .
Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork !
We're going to put in some new furniture .
Your address , please .
I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam .
All right . Leave these ads with me . I ' ll speak to him this morning .
Hi , Mikel . What's with you ? You look angry .
3 weeks
Yes . And another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ?
Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities .
My vegetables are very soggy .
No , I will call the attendants at the gate . I'll tell them you are on your way .
See you then !
That's it !
All right . Got it .
Tell me all about it .
For how many guests , please ?
Easy . Dial the area code for Connecticut ; then dial your friend's number .
Can you recommend me one ?
Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ' s go have a look .
I can't agree more . I think we'd better hire a guide so that we can learn more .
Well , Brad from school asked me out just today .
I think I'm going to China this vacation . How about you ?
What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?
Yes , we're making plans for a tour .
200 Yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed .
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! This one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !
Sure , may I have your name and account number please ?
Really . What do they mean ?
oh well . You never really liked your boss anyway , did you ?
It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ...
Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N .
Jump in , I'll give you a ride .
No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown .
I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it .
Did he tell you what she was like first ?
When will the plane reach for the morning flight ?
I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ' t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home .
Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers !
I'm watching TV .
Do you have a copy of the ID card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this ? The Legal Rep , I mean ? We also need the Loan Certificate as well . Do you have that ?
What time is the right moment ?
Cute , like you .
I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me .
Hey , Tom . You look tired . Are you all right ?
Okay , anything else I can get you ?
I'd like to speak your export manager , please .
A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games .
I'm really happy that you came to visit me .
Well , I'll try . Then what would you like to drink ? It's on me .
She is a beautiful bride .
Somebody broke into my house in the morning .
Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look .
Mandarin is the language I spoke since I was a child . So I can speak it very fluently .
Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible .
Oh , Jane . What on earth have you been ? I've called you a thousand times .
No problem . Is there anything else I can get for you ?
Yes , you can see every test for the past five years . You can compare them .
No , that's OK . I've got all of your information here on the screen in front of me . The money will be ready and waiting for you tomorrow .
I would like to check in . Here are my ticket and baggage .
In what section did you work in the hospital ?
How many credits for each course ?
What is your present address ?
Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark .
I got a parking ticket the other day .
Hi charles , I want you know that I finally found an apartment in Haitian .
Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder .
Yes , I think so . If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course .
Why is that ?
Yeah , but he refused to take the medicine .
No , I don ' t mind at all . I receive 3,000 RIB a month , after tax .
Oh , you've already grown up , son .
Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy .
Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway .
Would you like a lift home ?
I don't think so . I'm just shaken up a little .
Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ?
What is the tariff ?
Well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much .
Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit !
Actually they ' re expecting the baby to come on my birthday .
It makes sense .
Really ? I had no idea . Let me check . Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone .
I hope that we can continue our cooperation .
Is it a newcomer ?
Yes , thanks . Did you ?
Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy .
Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful .
I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen .
Thanks . Who do I call for trash collection ?
What a boring film !
It ' s two yuan .
So we'll compromise . We'll hit the Huangshan in Anti .
Oh , Ben has been cooking for us since I started attending this evening class . The good thing is , he has made great progress in cooking .
Yes , if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches .
It's a lot of money . But the picture is excellent , I'll take it .
The couple with the dogs-think back .
that's right ! I almost forgot about that .
Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ?
Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can .
I had to go get a cavity filled today .
Yes . How about you ?
That's a good idea . You are really creative .
You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps .
About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work .
Yes , this is the right bus .
Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us .
$ 3 075 . Our paychecks is $ 3 300 , combined . That means we don't have any receipts for $ 225 .
Are you sure we got on the right bus ?
The government is making efforts to change situation .
See you .
... OK . And here's your money .
And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .
Do you have any other positions available ?
You ' re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time .
No , ties . And there's a tie store . Let's go !
I ' m afraid not . I apologize .
So I think I may fall in love with her .
En ... and can you speak any foreign languages ?
You got a big return for a small gift .
May I know the definite date of delivery ?
Do you think I should turn down his offer ?
Well , it's basically two tanks -- one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent , a pump and a washing unit . Oh , and there ' s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system -- that stands for Process Logic Control .
Excuse me , Mr . Rodriguez ? Could I speak with you for a moment ?
Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ?
Absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago .
Perfect . Are you prepared to give me all your money ?
Milk , please .
Perhaps , but I haven ' t felt well for a few days now .
Sure , madam . But may l know how old he is ?
Not bad . I ' m confident . And I like challenges .
They are announcing your flight . You'd better board the plane .
Yes , I think so . I have just checked out . But I left my book in the room . Can I get it back ?
Good luck . I hope you each some fish .
Well , first you have to turn this switch on .
Yes . I ' ll take four shoulder chops and I ' d like a small chicken .
afraid of making a mistake .
I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ?
Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ?
But they don't let you have goods on approval .
Yeah , we don ' t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history .
I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days .
I am so happy for them .
I want to open a current account .
You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ' t even have met if I hadn ' t been in that car accident ten years ago !
Yep . I just can't decide what two cities to choose ...
I greatly appreciate this .
I heard that EDD has special services to help me get a job .
Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world .
Sir , your hair is done . Anything else I can do for you ?
Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms .
how about this blue sweater ?
Under which category do you intend to apply ?
Oh , yes , that is a beautiful color . It has been very popular blush this season . I have two left .
Yes , I need a wake-up call tomorrow at seven thirty .
Hello , Jim . Where are you going ?
OK , the postage is 275 yuan .
One moment , please ... Yes . There's a flight at 16:45 and one at 18:00 .
Just take it to a booth and begin voting .
Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue .
Of course . I almost missed my own wedding .
Swim stations ? Whoever heard of such a thing ?
I'll do that . Thank you . Have a safe trip home .
Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ?
You sure have a lot of discs here .
Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up .
How do I get to the Olympic Stadium , please ?
Yes . Right now I have a studio .
Thanks . Miss Zhang .
No , it ' s a dark brown suit .
What kind of magazine is it ?
It ' s the job I ' m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ' t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ' s a job I ' Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it .
Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck !
Is it possible for me to view the apartment today ?
Yes . Is that necessary ?
Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .
Yes , of course . I can't wait to be there .
Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hotpot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ?
How much will that cost ?
What you said was right , but we need to work as a team , how could you make adjustment to that ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
Sure , what would you like ?
Does Jim make a lot of money ?
May I ask for a wake-up call tomorrow morning ?
Hello , Mr . Smith , I am returning to Shanghai by the 10:00 plane . I am calling to thank you for all your help during my stay here .
Yes . There ' s one on the other side of the building .
How long has it been ?
Of course . Mary is our most experienced member .
I usually go to the supermarket , near the station .
You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ' ll issue you with a new one .
Not at the moment , thank you .
What examinations ?
You haven't told me anything yet .
Yes . That's perfect . I'll take it .
I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display .
How about tax and service charge ?
Good morning , Miss Bell !
Ok , I see . Thank you !
How did you first meet Jack each other ?
We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church .
Sure . Step in .
It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language .
This is Lucy White . Thank you . Bye .
Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one .
Suppose you have to do one of the two , which do you prefer ?
May I speak to Mrs . Liu , please ?
I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter .
I see . You must have more rest .
Yes , I do . Here it is , and the cash .
Can you help me ? The program is not responding and I don't know what to do .
This is 911 .
I'd like a permanent wave . By the way , do you have any picture of the latest hairstyle ? I ' Ve been in this style for so long that I want a change this time .
Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days .
Well , I want to be transferred to the Shanghai office .
Yes , this is the tenant of apartment ten . I guess my kitchen sink is clogging up again , and so is the bathtub .
Wow ! I'm impressed !
Is there anything you can do for me ? If I don ' t make it to shanghai in time , my wife is going go kill me .
It ' s a great car . It ' s very comfortable and it goes really fast .
Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ?
I am going to go to the bookstore .
Yes , that looks great ! Is it on our Open House list ?
Yes . We keep finding problems when testing the sound boards .
Well , I ' m afraid it isn ' t . It ' s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ?
what's the difference ?
I know , sweetie . Just open wide . Don't talk .
Isn ' t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food !
I don ' t think she will do such a thing .
What did I just say ?
No , I am not ill .
I'm looking for a pair of shoes .
Hello , Ann ! Is that you ?
Dan More's Office , how may I help you ?
That's not very fair . What did you do ?
My favorite recreation is cooking . I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well . It keeps me busy and makes me happy .
I know sir ! We didn ' t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box .
If you consider our high research costs and excellent quality , the price we are asking is only reasonable .
I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much .
Nope . How's the food there ?
Good luck here .
Look ! Someone is celebrating his birthday .
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights .
For what purpose exactly , if you don't mind me asking ? I must ask because I need to know the size , you see .
First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ' t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
Everybody is buying them .
Is it serious ?
Let me see . That ' s no problem . I ' ll see you then .
Sir this is the 56th floor ! We are on the 70th !
Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years .
I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend .
Do you have any fringe benefits ?
There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide .
Well , I ' ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ' s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ' ll just enjoy the holiday break .
haven't been sleeping well recently .
Thanks . Let's go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?
No , Even a dollar is all right . Here's your passbook , sir , just sign your name on it .
Oh ! You mean she doesn ' t have to work now ? It ' s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ' t it ?
Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs . Have you seen those signs ?
Don't worry . The pilot knows what he's doing .
Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .
No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5 . 00 pitchers on Mondays . So for ten , fifteen bucks , I can get a lot of drinks .
Would you like to withdraw any money ?
You came to the right spot . Come on in and join us !
I agree . We will leave $ 3 . 60 for the tip .
About half an hour .
Would you like something to eat ?
You look kind of green .
Single or return ?
Sure . Why don ' t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ' t taken a rest all morning .
I'm sleepy . I can hardly keep my eyes open .
Oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet .
Here . Catch !
One way trip . What's the fare , please ?
But then you have to change the litter box .
What happened before ?
Did you get my email ?
We ' re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend .
I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have .
That sounds pretty good .
You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss !
Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ?
Got it . Thank you , Shirley .
I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ?
Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .
I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park .
aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week .
That ' s not good for me at all . It'll have to be another time .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday .
Oh , that's not the same . I never pay for hotel souvenirs !
Hello , may I speak to Mr . Baker , please ?
Right . We should buy some yoghurt for kids .
How about insurance and full health insurance ?
But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem .
We hope you could visit our company again .
I'm Steven , your neighbour .
Yeah . It's already December , you know .
I'm from Textile Import and Export Corporation . I've come to meet you . My name is Zhang Yong .
It happened this morning .
What ? Why ? Can ' t you renew it ?
What ' s this here -- " house stock " ?
The sky is gray .
That's a high price .
We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year . You know , so we can have the funds put aside .
Wonderful . I ' m so excited .
Why's the plane shaking ?
Better hurry , sir . Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour .
I really like my debate class .
But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns .
I know . It took me three weeks , and I work here .
The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
Then it must be a naughty boy who did it .
Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do .
No , I don't .
Hello . I'm Ms Dawson from Lexington Software . I need to send these documents to Vietnam via L / C .
Yes . He's one of my best friends . Our friendship formed at college . Why did you ask that ?
We are lucky to play in a new stadium .
Actually , I am afraid I will be stuck in the job forever , if I choose a bad one .
I'll be glad when winter comes .
Yeah , about 5 minutes ago .
Hi , John , how was your vacation ?
Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble .
I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ?
It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ?
Why do they go there ?
You are in love with Mary , right ?
We have too many cars !
What an attractive place ! How can I get there ?
Yes , Mary ?
Just get out of my face , would you ?
What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ' re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ?
There isn't such a code ?
Yes , probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in .
Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ?
Take-out , please .
Oh , thanks , Mr . Kaufman . We look forward to your visit .
Sony please . Do you have extra charge for delivery ?
That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan .
It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field .
Great , thanks . But how can I get discharged ?
I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
maybe people don ' t like to have friends that are all the same . Most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends .
Is there anything else at the EDD offices to help me with my job search ?
He is then in a very difficult situation .
That is good of you .
Well . Don't forget to perform your duty next time , ok ? Now , let's start our lesson .
How hard is the climb ?
Medium rare , that ' s right , sir . I remember your order .
Yes , just in case we run into me new characters .
Which do you prefer , meat or fish ?
What do you think of the lawyer's speech ?
Not at all . I still have enough for the next few days .
Would you like to copy the EX files and pass me the copy ? There are some figures I want to check .
It seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions .
Sure ! Let ' s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks .
Eh , so so .
Fine then , what time are we going to leave ?
no problem .
I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government .
We use a vacuum cleaner that removes all the dirt , and we throw away all of the trash that we can find .
Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now .
OK . What's up , Madam ?
Dalian is my hometown .
No problem , just get rid of the bugs !
Well , we are rather full , sir . I'm not sure if I'll be able to find a vacant room .
I've actually been busy lately .
OK , I completely understand .
How much does this cost ?
We need to establish routine maintenance procedures . It costs us too much in lost production if we wait until something breaks down before we fix it .
Oh , no . Is it serious ?
I hear that there is a festival called Duanwu in China .
I see . And how about the working hours ?
I would like $ 150 .
That ' s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones .
You don't have to .
Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway .
You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health .
Now that our bread is ready , let ' s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ' s palate is different , but I ' m going to give you a few tips that you ' ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich .
Amenities ? What do you mean by amenities , sir ?
Would you please let the next applicant come in on your way out ?
My husband and I have thought about it , but we ' Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ' ll have in the future . What about you ?
Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili .
Are you a member of his fan club ?
Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry , sir ?
Classic . Something that could calm your mind .
Thank you . But I am not sure whether the manager is settling for it . She asked me to go to her office .
Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information .
I stayed at Bob's last night .
yes , I hope so . I am studying for my BELTS right now .
Can you do push-ups ?
Hello ! How do I restock my minibar ?
I understand . May I make an appointment then ?
I want take shell on a date , but I don ' t have much money .
Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another .
Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .
that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?
Thank you very much and anything else ?
Hey , David . Would you like some drinks ?
Now please tell me something about your past work achievements .
Are there any cities where it rains a lot ?
Thank you . How much is this kind of chocolate ?
At ten o'clock on the morning of next Sunday . We have invited all our relatives to the wedding .
Now let's talk about your interests and hobbies .
yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ?
I think so . Here it is . It's by the basin .
You ' d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence .
He was the best candidate this year .
Hmm . I see what you mean . Have you spoken with Roger ? He usually does better work than this .
Is there any chance to further study ?
Fine , I'll take a taxi .
What ? You golden watch is lost ?
Ok , I ' ll see you later .
Please give me some chicken .
No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis .
There is about a 15 - minute wait .
Could you help me to register for a class ?
How about oil or spray ?
I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run !
I'm fine , Mom . I feel so much better . I want to go to school . I'm missing out on all the fun .
Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ' s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a
No problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
I sure will .
Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste .
They give chocolate in return .
But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least .
First we will take some x-rays and see what we ' re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling .
Del Mar and Hill .
Are you going to leave ?
Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth .
Actually , I've told them a lot about you . They are excited to meet you .
Did you need help ?
I do feel like an outdoor exercise . After all , we haven't had such a beautiful day for a long time .
Here are some leaflets detailing everything we've discussed .
Yes , I'm the third child .
Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company .
absolutely . Every time when we do the reports , we love making some beautiful posters to emphasize our theme ideas .
Dam it , I'm running out of money again , I really need to balance my budget and handle my money better .
But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body .
Sure . That ' s not a problem . Do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester ?
Umm ... I think so . What's up ?
All right . I ' ll call her later .
Morning . Can I help you ?
Who wrote it ?
Yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ?
You have to take the math and English evaluation tests .
What packages do you have ?
Great play !
No , I don't think so .
All right . All done .
Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?
I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person .
Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?
Generally from the college
Great . I'll take one .
I'm afraid not . Every coin has two sides . I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction .
OK . I'll have a look at what I've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . Thanks for your help . Bye .
I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ' s try and be friends .
terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends .
Did you hear Peter just retired ?
Speaking . May I ask whom I am talking to ?
I'll take care of it .
How do you want to advertise the opening ?
Extremely good . I shot a 78 , including 5 birdies !
Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion .
I'm afraid we have no reservation by this name .
Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . We ' ll try it every day for seven days . Will that be all right ?

Well , I think we should save more . If we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better .
Sure . Can I get to the central department stall this way ?
We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ?
That ' s not bad at all .
You see this is the first time for me to use the swimming pool . I've got no idea about the water temperature of the pool . I'm afraid it might be a little cold .

I'm still suffering from a little jetlag .
It ' s very nice to meet you .

I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately .

I live in Beijing .
The same with me . Have you given much thought to what you want to do next ?
I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank .
Excuse me , sir ?
I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question .

The trust game was your favorite , huh ? My favorite part was the personality tests . I think to know more about what kind of personality type you are will tell you a lot about how you can fit into a team .

I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth .
I am sorry , sir . All the tables have been booked .
I am worried .
Yes , sir . For what time ?
Well , he ' s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn .

What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?
Very well , thanks .
I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool .

All right , Madam . It's ok . There is hardly any water in the radiator . It's dangerous , Madam . You could break down , because of the heat you know .
Well , here is the money .
No . I was here last semester , but I didn ' t find out about this class in time . So I ' m taking it this semester .

Have you been drinking ?
I am fine . What have you been doing ?
I want to come in the morning .
I took the dog for a walk .
Yes , can I see a few T-shirts , Please ?
That ' s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .
Hey , Jack , where's your car ?
I want an order of that . By the way , I want it hot . I like chili .
Certainly ! How much are you planning to spend on dinner , sir ?

Is the weather usually like this here ?
But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ?
Sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ?
As the saying goes , work while you work , play while play . All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy , you know ?
oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image .
Did you go camping last Saturday ?
I'm afraid ...
Get some snack foods , too , dude .
It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves .
What do you think is the biggest change ?
And when is your birthday ?
Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week .
Yes . It ' s only 5 minutes walk from the campus .
Shift it a little before you get up .
that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ?

That ' s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ' s really large .
That's no problem . It is made of linen , so you won't feel hot in it . I can assure you it is of superior quality . What is more , it is very popular with young women .

I think I would like that .
I'd prefer the night tour .
No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ?
The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
I do apologize for that .
Sure . how would you like to pay ?

It'll only take a couple of minutes .
Yes , I do . It ' s very interesting . What ' s your job ?
Perhaps you would like to talk to customer service .

OK , Ben and May , here we go . Be careful , Danny , the ball is coming . That is the green one .
Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley .
Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ?
No , is it difficult ?
If so , we may live there someday .
With snow in Kunming ? That's crazy !
No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room .
My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country .

Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries .
Apparently , you have unpaid late fees .
All you need is your student identification card to check out books .
My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . But my parents and I never see it outside of my city .
Could I have a refund on this ?
I see . It's very nice of you to help me . Is this form alright ?
What about ?

The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client .

Let me see . Ok , this way , please .
You look so excited . What happened ?
What ' s your major ?
if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it .
That's fine too .
You have to do something romantic .
How much does the green one cost ?

Yes , I am , rather . But I'll be all right by tomorrow and ready for business .
Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ' s check here ?
Hi , Linda . I have two concert complimentary tickets . Will you go with me tonight ?
I can try to get the book from a different library .

What is your specialty ?
Sure . What's the matter with you ?
Did you work at all during the last pay period ?
Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
On the bus . The driver collects the fares . You'll have to take your luggage on board .
I'll just use the ATM .
What can I do for you , Madam ?
I'll come see you tomorrow .
I don ' t think you guys have it .
You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network .
what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ?
Sorry , Dave , I didn't mean you . I am just not in the mood for this . I have work to do .
What have you learned ?
Hey , thanks , mum .
Really ? How to do that ?
You know , next week , we ' ll hold a football match . Our cheering squad is busy rehearsing the programmes for it
Are you having problems with it ?
I'm really sick of waiting for a bus .

Let me see your student ID .
I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself .
How did your interview go ?
Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him .
How time flies ! We have been lovers for nearly a year . We hit it off instantly .
Photograph or document ?
The laundry has sewed on a new button for you .
Hi , I have a checking account with you .
I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job .
You can say that again . The sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze . It ' s so lovely .
just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ?
Is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
Hey , Jim . I didn ' t know you biked to work .
Five .
I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ?
Well , except fishing . To be honest , I hate fishing , but I love all the others .
I'd like to help pitch in with dinner .
Dutch , where's that ?
Did you need something ?
Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker .
How do Mark and Jones compare , in your opinion ?
I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right .
Tell me about it .
You should have noticed unemployment insurance being deducted from your paycheck . Check your pay stubs .
That's acceptable .
Hi Kevin , how was your year at college ?
You bet !
You have to have your ticket checked .
I work for Thomas Cook Travel .
That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth .
What makes you angry ?
Oh , there Isn't ? Oh , no .
Thanks . I will .
Are you serious this time ? That ' s wonderful news .
Is that it ?
Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ' s really unreliable . Sometimes he ' s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting !
B :: Come on ! I just took a glance .
Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus .
More than 2000 now .
Are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
Really good ! you should try it sometime .
Yes . My only recreation is skateboarding .
Great ! That's settled then .
What was it doing there ?
I didn ' t pay attention to that .
Yes , maybe you can come on Friday .
Then keep up the good work .
Just fine , and you ?
Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .
that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much .
To tell you the truth , I am on the diet .
When did it become CABS ?
For killing time and making new friends .
Okay . Good night . Have a good dream .
Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .
Thanks for your support and care .
Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ?
Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much .
One less car on the road means less pollution .
Wow , you really live in the Stone Age , Mom .
Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world .
Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
No way , mom . I don't like piano .
Mom , will you tuck me in tonight ?
No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ' s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ' t be older than that .
Good morning , Jim !
Hold on a moment please ... Sorry , the flight from London has been delayed . It departed two hours later than scheduled . The whether in London was really bad .
Thank you very much . May I leave my baggage here until Thursday ?
That's more convenient .
Perhaps you saw a silverfish , sir .
You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning . If you cannot afford an attorney , one will be appointed for you . Do you understand ?
Good gracious . That ' s incredible !
This is Susan . Would you mind taking charge of decorating the office for our Christmas party ?
Be careful , Tom . Those are pretty heavy .
We will consider the first part of the year , in your particular field , and your credit rating can be no less than class A , during that period .

Let's rock n ' roll .
Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself .
May I see your receipt ?
what's the expiration date on your passport ?
Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ?
Did you ? And what did you study ?
I wish my parents were a little more lenient .
I don ' t know . Do you want to go bowling at the new bowling alley on 1st street ?
Everything you are doing is perfect .
You too . Bye .
One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
I have a problem .
I am not very sure . Maybe for three days .
These ones here . The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add .
It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions .
have you ever experiences a flood ?
Thanks . I finally got rid of that old Nissan that got me through college .
Got it . Thank you .
Good evening , madam . Did you ring for service ? Who can I do for you ?
no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t
We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water .
Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere .
Hold on for a moment . ( a few minutes later ) I have cancelled your reservation . Shall I make another one for you ?

I want to have a continental breakfast .
I really like Caesar salads .
Um . . . let me double check . . . unfortunately , she ' s booked solid on Thursday , how does next Monday work for you ?
I couldn't . I was bound and gagged .
The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ' s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny an
I apologize again for the cockroaches , sir . I hope you have a nice trip home .
Well , If I were you , I would go to the police station straight away and calling .
Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken .
Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won't you ?
Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image .
I already voted .
Three , Doctor .
What is the salary while on probation ?
You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit .
That's it ? That's the tradition ?
what kind of dishes do you usually make ?
Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ?
A woman after my own heart ...
Sure . Here is your receipt and you can draw your tax paid for those goods at customs .
Did you feed the puppies today ?
Maybe you are right .
Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ?
Excuse me , I wonder if you can help me .
I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food . So we miss the food in Taiwan too much . Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .
Do you have cheongsams ?
Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over .
Excuse me , miss . Could I have something to drink , please ?
Yes , I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
Hello , my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight .
How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ?
Regular or unleaded ?
Don't believe him . He's liar .
Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive .
So what does your family do on Christmas Day ?
No , that's quite out of the question .
At 2 o'clock , I switched to the Channel 6 , and watched a terrific movie without commercials .
Why did you put it off until the last minute ?
You know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ?
I know . Hold your position and say cheese .
I've been missing you like crazy .
I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
Mmmm . I ' m not sure if we have you down here . How do you spell your last name ?
I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ' s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music .
It ' s badly organized . I can ' t present this to the board .
Lucy , I ' d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?
Did you ? And what course did you take there ?
How do you usually spend your time , now that you ' Ve retired ?
Have you got a sore throat , too ?
That sounds like a good idea . The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .
I'm going to do that then .
I go to bed , but I just can ' t get comfortable enough to stay asleep .
Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ?
Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out .
Oh , nothing .
The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting .
No sweat . Just go back and talk him down . Here comes Wei .
Yes , here it is .
I have no idea , any suggestions ?
you're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him .
My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old .
Hah , as the sales department director , you are the best .
I see . What's the interest like on those ?
I need to make a withdrawal .
I don't understand .
May I ask who's the manager ?
Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
Ok , I'll make sure she gets the message .
Don't you think it ' s too noisy here ? The rock music ! I can hardly bear it .
Do you have any cheaper ones ?
does it have a camera ?
Why ? I don ' t have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I ' m looking for . This way , I just search for it online quick and easy .
And we're going to have summer vacation .
What do you think of the former champ ?
Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ?
He is fine .
Come with me .
You need to get some rest , as you have to get up early in the morning .
Good morning , Passport , please .
OK , thanks a lot . See you then .
Now I want you to look some pictures .
Okay , that's good .
Yes , I think he ' s the most relaxed person in management .
No , don't bother .
Sure . By all means please do . Please take a seat .
I will check to see what my budget is .
Yeah , he didn't come home until 12:00 AM .
That will be gorgeous !
I don't know , but I'm sure the produce person can tell you .
Ok , shall we go to Pizza Hut or Pizza Italia ?
That's too bad , But don't worry . We ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock .
I didn't bring my ID .
do you often go to concerts ?
Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists .
Mr . : As soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement .
Yes , we do . My parents prepare dinner for me .
I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking .
His parents must feel very happy .
Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master .
it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
I understand that . Still , I'm not in a position to help you . Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together .
O . K . , maybe if I have someone to go with , I ' ll be able to get up in time for a jog .
Neither too cold , nor too hot .
I agree . I like guys that can make me laugh .
I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs .
What am I being tested for ?
May I take a look inside ?
Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ?
Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
When did it first break down ?
Show me your card , please .
I left it at my parent's house , but I need one here as well . I've been using Jim's old bike but he needs it back .
Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising .
I enjoy the different types of instruments that they use .
Wow ! A third more ? Very good .
It is incredible .
I see . The bus doesn't come so often as in cities .
No , I haven't sir .
My diet consists mainly of fruits , veggies , and chicken .
That sounds good . Which one do you recommend ?
Go to yahoo . com and click on " Travel " and " Tickets . " They ' ll be about a billion sites to look at .
Did you find something you like ?
no . they don ' t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
How long will it take to get to Shanghai .
Besides the official holidays , our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year , which makes it possible for you to visit your parents . Any other questions ?

I wouldn ' t miss it for the world ! It ' s sure to be fun . She ' s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ?
It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system .

Flowers for my favorite girl .

It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
That sounds good ! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation ?
Mom ! That is so unfair !
Not a lot . What about you ?
How will you solve the problem ?
What seems to be the problem ?

Yes , there are always pros and cons to making a career change .
You ' re all set to leave .
I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you . You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ?
We can provide you with information that will help you understand what is available . We also provide workshops .
No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ' t get that many English singers !

When do you think you will do that ?
OK . Do you have any advantages to work in our entry agency ?

And plate number .

Yes , I received the scholarship 3 times on end .
Leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom . Just close the cubby door and walk away .

You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ?
There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday .
What do we do first ?
That ' s a good idea .
Well , let me check for you . Yes , you are booked already . It's a single room with a bath , facing the south .
You two are so health-conscious !
Yes , of course . I think our travel agent would have made the reservation for us .
I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend , Mark .
You have been so busy these months . What are you up to ?
Just so so . But we can travel twice every year .

Yes , and I'm a very good driver .
I think a crew cut is the most suitable for you .
How many windows are there in the apartment ?
Excited about what ?
First , I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .

Sorry sir . We can't . Cash only .
Johnny , I want to thank you .

Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays .
You haven't had any experience in either of those fields .

Maybe . But I ' d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds .
Aisle , please .

I am fed up the ready-made suit . Can you recommend me some stuff for me to make one ?
All kinds of insects dress themselves up . They drive straight their own Flower Cars along the Parade Avenue of Ants Kingdom .

Yes , in our company , the women have a two-week vacation a year , besides this , if you are a married woman , maternity leave for some months is permitted .

Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ?

Yeah ?
I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll .
So I have , but I has reminded me at least one thing I need to remember .
It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets !
Have you ever had snow in your city ?
And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ?
It was the first time . You should not be so particular .
Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps !
Certainly , sir . What is the flight number and when are you leaving ?
It's fine with me .
How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful .

Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ?
The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car -- even in the summer !
1 week . Would you recommend me scenic spots to see there ?
That sounds good . I'll take the escalator .
So why aren't you driving it ?
Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog .
If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
I vacuumed the entire house .
You've got no guts !
What you said is absolutely right . I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet .
They weren ' t supposed to arrest me .
But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night . You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ?
Oh , did you get a job ?
Yeah . I bet you did forget everything . What's the date today , do you know ?
No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter .
For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play .
Uh ... yeah . Hi ! Is Susie there ?
This microwave stove has many functions . Let me show you . For example , if you want to cook meat , you just need to put meat in it , and press the button with a picture of meat , that ' s OK . After several minutes , you can eat the delicious meat .
Oh , we're lucky today , aren't we ?
I'll have Chicken and Ginger Burger with Chilli Dressing .
When it comes to select a fund , you will always read " Past performance is not an indication of future results " , can you believe that ?
I brought my transcript from my first year . Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall .
Of course !
Your Honor , I am ready to make my plea .
So , would you make gay marriage legal ?
Let me give you a hand . The author is ...
Is there anything on sale today ?
I did the same . I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents . I hope I didn ' t forget to buy anyone something !
Oh , don ' t go yet . Let ' s at least have one more .
Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own .
Oh , never mind about that .
Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ?
Maybe not . Could you buy some while you're out ?
Sorry , I don ' t quite follow you .
30 % of the people are attracted by the style . Buyers always pay great attention to packing . In my opinion , these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing .
Only 700 yuan .
OK . Here you are . If there are no questions , could we have your signature in the blank below ?
So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year .
I ' m looking for a bookcase , but I don ' t want to buy a new one .
It's located right under our lobby . Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down .
He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ?
Here are the letter and the money .
I ' d like to bring to ABC Company not only my technical skills , ambition , enthusiasm , but also my loyalty , a sensor desire to become an administrative assistant . It is the hardest of my career plans .
How is your job search going , Janet ?
You have quite a range , haven't you ?
Where do you live ?
I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it .
About 100 words a minute .
Walk all the way down Fair Oaks , and catch the 267 on Altadena Drive .
Exactly what ?
We won't charge any extra if you'd vacate the room by two o'clock .
I am also impressed with the lines in the movie .
That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price .
Hmm ... you're right . Well , I guess ' Terminator ' is an exception to the rule .
Yes , what's in the package , madam ?
Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers .
I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place !
Judy , what is everybody talking about ?
An empty house is easier to paint and clean . Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in .
Congratulations . That's great !
I think I may rent this apartment from you .
Well , I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you .
Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ?
Yes , we do , Madam . Thank you , madam . Here ' s our welcome brochure with all of information of our facilities . My name is John . If you need any help do let me know . I ' m at your service .
It's too biased . I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting .
Reading newspaper on the couch .
Oh , that's too expensive . Aren ' t there any cheaper ones ?
A description of each test is given on the site .
I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer .
What's bothering that guy ?
OK . Four saucers . We can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning .
Well , there ' s nothing we can ' t handle . I ' ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fu
I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ?
Actually , no . It should be a suite . I had booked a non-smoking king .
I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension number .
Good Point !
01088256798
Yes . You are right .
Thank you very much . I will introduce your property to our clients . When they want to see your property , I will give you a call .
Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat .
Myrdal , purse doesn ' t just disappear . Think carefully . When did you have it last ?
I ride a motorcycle .
Who's that over here ?
Can I get you anything else ?
So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years .
Tom , hi , this is Mary with Gold Star Mortgage .
Certainly I do .
Sure did . It's a beauty . Where do you want it ?
Good evening , John .
Do you really like it ?
May I see your ID ?
Are the batteries in it made by your people ?
This dress is beautiful . May I try it on ?
I am afraid we are sticking to our choice .
then who will you meet tonight ?
Excuse me . I'd like to cash the traveler's check .
Which book ? Your cookbook ?
OK , go on .
Well he ' s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories .
I'll show you how . The bar tenders know whose turn it is . And also , I can snap my fingers to catch his attention .
Oh , no ! Did you call the police ?
Hello , there . I'd like to know about Clean Collection . My company in the US is going to send me a cheque . It's for my wages , but I'm not too sure about how to cash it here .
I need it for the parking meter .
Goodbye . Thanks again .
She's demanding . But I like that . I mean , I know our timeline is tight .
1218 . we ' ll collect your luggage at nine o ' clock tomorrow . Would you then come to the front desk to get your storage receipt please ?
That doesn ' t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them .
I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ?
I just feel funny .
Oh , it hasn ' t been painted yet .
Do you have any other questions ?
That's quite steep . Can you come down a little bit ?
Thank you for your interest in our company .
I've already got a small pan . I need a big one .
We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units .
It should be under Leslie Smith . The number is 184796 A .
Do you think you will ever work at that company again ?
Well , I haven't been to the theater in a long time .
Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ?
Oh , it ' s open . Thank you very much .
I'll bet he enjoyed his walk .
I will make it now .
Let me help you . OK , this is the one you want . Push this button to change the channel . We have 6 channels in all . Have a good day .
That will be great .
Ok , but what will you do if you want to check the size of the clothes ?
OK . Two tickets to London , please .
I love you . And I think you ' re awesome .
No , thank you . I have brought some .
That's amazing !
it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy .
Doctor Ruth's office , may I help you ?
What ' s your flight number ?
Could I check out this book ?
My name is Steven . What's your name ?
Really ? What could that be ?
And which child is this ?
I did experience a winter with snow in Kunming , the Spring City .
It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American .
Good evening , can I get you a drink ?
We have the room color designed for our guest .
Yes . I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store .
Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times .
Excuse me , could you tell me whether there is a restaurant near here ?
I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it .
He's prejudiced , isn't he ?
I noticed that too . What are the people learning ?
Yes , I do , very much .
the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ?
It's time for you to wake up .
William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ?
Since it is low season , we are running a special rate right now of 150 yuan per night .
Yes , it looks perfect .
So you said you and Amanda met through a mutual friend . How did it happen ?
That's great . I'll wait . See you next weekend .
She's going to kill you .
No , I have never been told that I have high blood pressure .
Her line is through now , please go ahead .
You know . You ' re right . The bushes are covering the sign .
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the happier I am .
All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession .
It ' s quite large . It ' s about 40 square meters .
Let me see . Wash the cabbage over there .
Our rooms include television set , air-conditioning and a bathroom .
I trust you .
Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building ?
I'd like to rent a safety deposit box here , please .
Today is September 28th , 2007 .
You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ' s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ?
That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks .
So how ' s everything going for Christmas ?
Last year we made a big snowman .
Yes . I ' ll have an ice tea . You ' ll see it next to the lemonade .
Busy with your work again ?
Your lease isn ' t up yet .
Am . No , I have an urgency to talk with him .
I have a Promissory Note , but it's not called that . It's a Bill of Exchange .
Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know .
So how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?
By air of course .
OK , let's have a try .
Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ?
Mary , there's one more thing that you must do for me before you leave .
But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that .
I've been really busy . How is everything ?
What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
Look at this mountain bike . It is only £ 330 . Do you like it ?
If you don't mind , Mr . Smith , please go to counter number six to queue up and wait for the service .
Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then .
Well , what do you like doing ?
Excuse me , but could I use your bathroom ?
That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .
Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday .
What is it ? What happened ?
Bob , I'm really upset with you .
I'll come back to China tonight . I hope to see you again sometime .
Well . First you have to turn this switch on .
Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook .
This pair fits me perfectly . I feel comfortable .
Excuse me , Mr . Macmillan ?
Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?
Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ' s a lot ice on the roads .
Yes , please . I'll really appreciate that .
sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well .
You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can't do anything this afternoon like this . Gee ! You've got a fever .
just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively .
Yes , sir . What's the matter ?
How do you plan to accomplish this ?
No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing .
I'd like to leave on Nov . 2nd and return on Nov . 21st .
That's good to hear .
Surely of course .
I think this one fits you . It's the new fashion style .
Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night !
Well , we could go to a movie . Have you see Shrek 2 ?
Fine , I ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
I was taught in high school how to draw and paint .
Don ' t you think it needs about a little taken off and talk to .
No , she's at school .
Jingshan consists of five individual peaks , and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak . These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time . These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing .
I'm almost finished .
I think that's an excellent reason to like something .
The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports .
No , but that was a random change of subject .
I'm afraid not , sir .
It doesn ' t matter how much .
May's birthday is coming . Shall we buy her a birthday present or let her choose one for herself ?
Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today . They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf . You will fall and fall and fall .
Wrong number .
Hi , Kenji .
Ok , you are really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ?
I want to have a suit made to measure .
A dime is still a bargain , sir .
no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it .
I bought one size up by mistake .
I can't believe it .
Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment .
Ok . Got it . Thanks for you help .
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?
What about the kitchen ?
Neither do I . I don't like any kind of modern dances all .
How much do you expect to earn ?
Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
Well , this is not quite the style I want . Have you any suit in fashion ?
Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me .
oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
Why ? What does she want to be ?
Yes . If I don ' t make it to Beijing tomorrow morning . my wife would kill me . How much does it cost ?
Our company enjoys a history of more than twenty years , we have wide connection with wholesalers and retailers all over the America , and we have good reputation in the commercial circle .
May I have some water , please ?
You are so thoughtful .
But if I have more than 55 pounds , what can I do ?
I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market .
These are French coats , sir . They are quite fashionable these days .
OK , I will .
Yes , please . I'm a little thirsty , actually .
How do you like waltz ?
One is 4 months and the other is years old .
Not too much . I've been pretty busy .
Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity .
Since the day before yesterday .
Hi . Can I help you with anything ?
I ' ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner .
Could you give some information on your European tours ?
Where is that ?
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ?
First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 .
Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case .
( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge .
What should I bring with me ?
What do you think are the qualifications for being a doctor ?
No , why should I ? The Globe ' s help wanted section is the best .
Yes , do you have any flights to Sydney next Tuesday afternoon ?
Really ? Was it delicious ?
Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot !
I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that decision until later .
Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you .
Nice to meet you .
You mean Lily ' s boyfriend ?
I don't know .. Well , maybe you are right , but how am I gonna tell her ?
Hello , Cindy . Congratulations ! I hear you ' re getting married .
Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape .
Cats are beautiful and lovely , aren ' t they ?
That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ?
Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ?
How long have you waited ?
How about Sunday then ?
I especially like the wonderful chicken dish .
Thank you . I never can find my way around this store .
See , I helped you out .
I guess it can't be helped .
That'll cost too much .
And do you really love her ?
But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ' Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ' s not easy , I know . It ' s hard .
How about afternoon ?
I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting .
Nothing much . What's new with you ?
I definitely want to meet with you , Mr . Parker . I just need to sort out my schedule .
Save it . If you want something to eat , then make it yourself .
I don ' t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ' t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ' m looking for .
Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment .
Phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . You should know how to use them .
I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast .
Ok ! We'll definitely go to visit your company .
Where do they come from ?
Thank you . But I ' m not interested .
Oh . I'm just going to take it easy .
Weren ' t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ?
I feel like to wear my hair in this way .
One last question . Is there a dress code there ?
This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here .
The car is beautiful , isn't it ? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price .
The chicken is also nice .
I am .
What do you plan on doing after you retire ?
We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !
You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours .
I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant .
What hairstyle do you feel will look best on me ?
I think I have traits of both , actually . I look more like my mother .
Can you put me through to Mr . Lining ?
How nice of him ! I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ?
Excuse me , where can I find a guide ?
That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm .
Tell me a little bit about yourself , please .
Oh , David . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What should I do if he doesn't call me ?
I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work .
Don ' t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine .
Too bad . But , is there any other leather store nearby ?
No . It is Wang .
Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .
Well , I really like being with her .
What's so special today ?
Very well , thank you , Mr . Parker .
It's correct . Is there any way I can change it back before I leave the country ?
I will see you tomorrow .
So , are you still going to have cereal ?
Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you .
Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all .
Whatever we said , we must be more careful .
Oh , look at these two watches , aren't they lovely ?
OK . Can you give me a fragile label ?
Hello , there . I've just started using your net banking and I'm looking for some information about my Commission Fund .
OK . I will be right back with your desserts and drinks .
I ' m relieved to hear that . Anyway , it ' s my fault .
What are you talking about ? I have salads some times .
Don ' t you think she is a bit out of my way ?
What's the price of these mangoes ?
The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment .
Yes , I think AC Milan's foot work is much better on the whole .
You must enjoy yourself .
I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer .
When in Rome , do as the Romans do .
Yes . If she doesn't believe it , Christmas won't be so exciting to her .
That ' s really interesting , you have to play for me some time .
I would like to book a one way trip ticket .
That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics .
Fine , we'll be expecting you then .
Do you have a reservation ?
Any other facilities ?
Thank you , Mr . Johnson . May I ask you one more question ? When will your property become available ?
Yes . I'm sure he will . I'll take it .
If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail .
It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that .
Wow ! Sure !
I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too .
Do you think this blouse really suits me ?
I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
I'm leaving on November 10th .
Is it drip-dry ?
Yes , but have you made an appointment ahead ?
I knew that already .
I park in the daytime .
Just me this time .
Good afternoon , Mr . Anderson .
Thank you ! I am glad to hear that . When would it be convenient for me to start working ?
Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ' s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online .
She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars . com web site by the end of next week .
Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it .
Oath , I think I broke my leg .
People who have just got married feel that the world is right before them .
What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ?
Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ?
I'm headed to Rockefeller Center .
But they are not as convenient as the subway .
that's not too far away . Do you think I'll get a visa ?
I want to lose some weight !
So what do you think it is ?
That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ' s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ?
I see , but how do you pay for it ? How do you know you aren ' t going to be ripped off by the seller ?
Arriving the 25th of September and leaving on the 28th ? Three nights ?
Well , I guess you don't want this note , then .
How is your computer skill ?
I think we ' ll be better off if we are apart .
Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make .
that cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ' s that stain ?
How do I get there from here ?
No , I'll go by myself , thanks .
He should be back in ten minutes . Could 1 you call back later ?
Would you like some more ?
We can certainly give you faster turnaround , but it will cost you extra .
We agreed that the deadline was next Friday .
Yes , please . That is very kind of you .
How many credits are you taking this semester ?
And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible .
All my children are agile .
Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well . But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving .
Oh . my god . But I have to be there on Sunday . I want to go on stand-by .
How about overtime work ?
What are your hours on Saturday ?
I'd like to check out .
No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' .
No . I listened to records and studied , what did you do yesterday , Donald ?
How Ay clients do you have already ?
Do you have any plans ?
We are ready to help you .
There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .
How's business ?
You're right , sir . Your whole day is still ahead of you .
You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me ...
let me just grab your file . How long have you worked for us now ?
Please let me check ... Tomorrow afternoon ... Yes , he'll be free from 3:00 tomorrow afternoon . Do you think it's convenient for you ?
Shut up !
That's too much for us really .
What words ? Can you tell me ?
Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ?
I don't think you really want to hear about it .
Yes . He ' s never said anything so I never told him . But now that he ' s getting older ...
Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?
Are you sure you can do well this year ?
He's there .
I live in an apartment downtown .
I don't think we can make it .
Yes . It ' s easy and convenient to use a computer . But it takes a long time to really master it .
Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
It includes everything except cable TV , and telephone .
R :: Good morning . Room Reservations . May I help you ?
Slow down and tell me your address .
I ' m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ' s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .
Are you going anywhere ?
Maybe it's because Susan's parents are both painters .
you have good fashion sense , Karen .
I don't think I can manage this morning . I wonder if we could after the time of meeting to tomorrow afternoon .
Great . They've all got built-in TVs .
What are the temperatures in winter ? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees .
Did you need help finding anything else ?
Shoes ? You already have a closet full of shoes .
Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well .
Sure . Here is the mirror .
Sorry , we don't . But I think you can fly on Northwest Airlines to Berlin and then have a connecting flight on Canada Airline to Toronto . And it is the most economical flight , just 1,900 dollars .
Looks like it . You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest .
Okay , I will try it on .
When , exactly do you need to leave ?
Yes , it's perfect .
Well , If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much .
Oh , yes , I have . I worked part-time as a typewriter in a computer company when I was at college .
Yes , welcome to our company . I hope we can cooperate happily .
Have you switched on the radiator ?
Oh , you ' re not listening to me .
Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions .
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !
No , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling .
Very well .
Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ?
This small town has many serious problems .
I've been at this for two weeks now and nothing ' s turned up .
Don't you dare tell me that ...
What happened , Peter ? Did you have a fight ?
Someone will be out to take a look any minute now .
No , he just stole all of my things .
OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you .
Some people say that history repeats itself .
What section does it have ?
Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on .
You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to .
Have you worked anywhere else before ?
I see . Is the telephone on the table good for outside calls ?
I knew you'd come around ...
Pure gold or carats ?
Well , all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
It was founded in 2002 , has been in business for 10 years .
It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood .
In what business are you most interested in this organization ?
Yes . Nice to meet you !
Robin , what are you going to do tomorrow ?
How is your business going ?
Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on .
Sure , anything else ?
We finally get a chance to meet .
Canada is north of here .
Well , I want 1,000 yuan in traveler's checks and the rest in cash .
oh , you have too wild of an imagination .
It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own .
The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ' s a special one just for kids .
I don ' t have one time in particular . I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired .
Are you more of a follower or a leader ?
Hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?
Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight , shall we ?
What sport are you good at ?
Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ?
What happened yesterday ? You forgot our date , didn ' t you ?
I need something to eat , please .
Oh , the packing looks very nice .
I think so . I won't forget anything important . As long as I have my passport , VISA card and airline ticket . It will be OK .
I don't care about any of that .
it's a PC . doesn't everyone have a PC in this office ?
I really appreciate your time and help . See you then .
We went to Europe .
Oh , no ! Now I'll be late .
Of course . I stay online for four hours at least every day .
That's too bad . So , what did you ask for Christmas this year ?
Yes , it would be my first trip overseas . Actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country .
morning , Mr . Winthrop . This is Sally Parker , Mr . Emory ' s secretary . Mr . Emory has asked me to set up a meeting with you .
Yes , sure . To be honest , nobody would like to work overtime . However , we have to if it is necessary for our company . I would do that if it is the call of duty .
It depends on your height and body type .
I've been to Salt Lake City a few times . I really like your city .
I know , I know . Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .
Not bad . But too hot for me today .
Yes , but I am out of food and milk .
Do you need a hand with that ?
Sure . But it is too cold today . I have to put on warm clothes and look stupid .
All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation .
It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon , Ms . Barkley .
Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather .
Really ? Where did you hear that ?
So the reform can not be carried out well .
Do you know anyone who ' s had plastic surgery ?
Shall I make out a receipt ?
You didn't come to work yesterday . What happened ?
First National Bank .
It might be the English teacher . What about you ?
What kind of job are you interested in ?
I want to check out today . My plane leaves at 3 p . m .
I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much .
All I make is oatmeal , toast , and some orange juice .
OK . I ' ll have them . Is there any soup ?
When will I know your decision ?
We still have to do about ten more .
Hello , I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning .
Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee .
If you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ?
Well , if you don't have any questions , shall we get started ? If you'll follow me , first I'll take you to the site of our semi-conductor system ...
Is the Chinese team taking the lead ?
Have you ?
Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st . When is your birthday ?
You really have talent . How did you learn to do this ?
What things am I allowed to check out ?
Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use .
Yes , I am , but I think it ' s time for some plastic surgery I ' m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ?
If you have any good jobs , keep an eye for me !
Good afternoon , madam . Can I help you ?
Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning .
Hi , Kathy ! I'm just doing my morning yoga ! You're up awfully early today .
Hmmm . Not good . They ' re too tight . The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ' s pinching my toes . And there ' d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ' t think I have the patience fo
I know . I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave .
Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ...
No , it's D408 , my parking space . I have already paid for it .
Evan , are you busy right now ?
Yes , and then other qualitative factors , such as the transparency of your business operations , your credibility and the integrity of your management .
This is a good opportunity .
Trust me . Everything will go well .
What's for dinner tonight ?
I can ' t take that .
In South America , the most common language is Spanish and Portuguese .
Yes , it does . Does he go to school by bus ?
Really ? Dad , how do you know how to plant organic vegetable ?
I won ' t be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow .
No way . Look . That's what the meter says .
I was wondering if you'd let me stay here for a few days .
Your appetite is good .
Oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?
did you tell him ?
By the way , what's the rate for a single room ?
Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
No . Is there any direct flight to New York ?
That's fine . What salary do you get at your present position ?
That ' s a good idea if you can find employment nearby .
All right . I'll tell him when he comes back .
do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?
906 Ottawa street . My name is David Yang . My phone number is 713-786-0234 .
yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ?
Oh , that's all right .
I hope so . But I'm always caught short .
Do you have any blue shirts ?
Very well . What about you ?
On the contrary , I think he's very serious .
no , but we're trying to contact them .
Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning .
Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening .
it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
What time would you like the reservation for ?
I'm all done now .
Er , let me see . Oh , look , you're right here . Pretty close to the Olympic Park .
I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ?
Are you almost finished with my hair ?
She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ?
Also , Mr . Johnson , I would like to remind you my company will charge a commission equivalent to one percent of the transaction price in the event of a successful selling of the property through our introduction .
Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the police ?
Yes , I do . If you ask around , other people will tell you the same thing .
I'll work hard .
I don't believe it .
can't you hang out with them , too ?
I am not the person who committed that crime .
Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks .
Well , most of my time here was pleasant . And New York itself is fantastic .
Someone told Joe off .
I really like Japanese or Thai food .
Are you ready to leave ?
Of course ! Will you ?
Are you telling me you're not going to meet with me ?
By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ?
When's the first stop ?
I'm still feeling under the weather .
That is a very quick meal to make .
Sorry , sir . I came late because I had to send for the doctor for my grandfather .
How would you like this order shipped ?
If there really was a stop sign , I couldn't see it because of the overgrown bushes .
I hear that he's quitting .
what I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat .
It's really cold . It snowed all day and the school closed early .
Come in , young man .
Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy .
Right . Trains No . 13 and No . 14 are the best trains on the line between Beijing and Shanghai . Which seats do you prefer , cushioned seats , ordinary seats , cushioned berth , or ordinary berth ?
They killed another hostage .
That is all right . Maybe we can make another arrangement .
The reason is that he once was bitten by a dog .
did it come out ?
I'm sure you're ready .
It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
We cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
All right ! Thank you .
No I'm not ready yet . I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face . Can you wait for a few minutes ?
On the contrary ! It really refreshes you and gets you ready to attack the day .
We have Italian , French , thousand island and blue cheese .
Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house .
I backed into it while I was trying to get into the parking lot .
Let's go and get some cookies . I am hungry now .
Would you be able to reserve it for me ?
I'm sorry , but I have an appointment this evening . How about tomorrow evening ?
Good morning . I would like to make a reservation to Hong Kong for August 2 .
I'm going to England by flight B . E . 987 .
Exactly . He is unbelievable .
Oh , I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat .
Is breakfast served here ?
I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out .
You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress !
My laptop , do you see it ?
All you have to do now is vote .
Yes , but this will be my first time voting .
Well , give me a call if you can ' t make it for some reason .
Where shall I put it , miss ?
Two cars forward .
How long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue ?
How's it ?
We'll have our own Secure Internet Banking Service . What it is , is a sort of online financial service for enterprises and individuals , so you could get it . It's for doing all types of e-business .
Hi , Craig ! How are you ?
Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully .
Sorry , sir . We accept cash only .
I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone .
No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
That ' s right . But I have bothered him several times .
I have lived in Taichung for two years now . So this is the second time I am going back to states . I go back once a year to visit my family .
The shows are dull and they ' re too many advertisements .
Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .
Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ?
At seven thirty pm , Longing Chinese restaurant . And I'll go to your home and pick you up at 7 .
We'd like to have western food today . Could you tell us something about it ?
Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road .
Of course .
Yeah , we should have more roads built .
Sure , you can , but you ' ll be charged for $ 10 .
Of course . First of all , she must have a strong sense of responsibility .
When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ?
She studies English .
Anytime after six will be fine .
Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ?
What are you going to look for ?
I think that would be horrible !
That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ?
He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us .
Let me see . Yes , that one still has seats available . Would you like me to reserve a seat for you ?
It ' s really not necessary . I know your intention was good .
Print shop . Seam speaking .
Not bad . There ' s a new English teacher .
Well , I prefer filet , but porterhouse is good , too .
Well , Mark Smith , who was the first president , founded the company in Ottawa in 1955 . It has 1 . 5 billion dollars in capital . it employs 8,000 people , and it is the largest company in its field in Canada .
That is one option , Madam . If your are travelling to either Hong Kong or Macau we are permitted to exchange up to 1,000 USD for you .
I'm sorry to hear that . Did you check your shoulder bag carefully ?
Yes , it is . You also have free use of the leisure facilities here .
Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital .
Look ! There are playing The Matrix today .
So , this is the worst story I ' Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim .
I'm sorry . All the appointments are filled .
Yeah . But why don ' t you come by your office tomorrow to sign the lease ?
Can I take a shower ?
I don ' t mind if you want to .
It's very nice , I like it very much .
Pretty well , I guess .
The same to you .
Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
Of course , you can . Wait a moment .
Happy Thanksgiving !
Let's all go together then .
We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .
These drawings on the wall are process sheets .
I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy .
Basically , what I need from you now is your driver ' s license or some ID that shows your residency status .
Can we add up this item to the agreement ?
We put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account .
I'm not sure .
I want to tell you that I like you
Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down .
Excuse me . Miss , what does the doctor say about me ? When can I be discharged ?
That ' s a really long line . How long do you think it ' ll take to get through all those people ?
I'll take your word for it .
Yeah ! But French is not easy to learn .
Let me see . It's a one day tour .
You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours .
Hi ! Do you know what's for dinner ? I'm starving !
Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us .
Sure . What are they ?
Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look .
Can you tell me the time ?
Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue .
Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company .
I ' ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ' Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating .
Sir , you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab .
Okay , I ' ll take it .
It is serious .
When ? I saw him well last month .
I love anything with chocolate the best .
What about the Yellowstone National Park ?
I don't have it .
Hi , I need to talk with the property manager right away !
Oh , about 6:00 . Will that be OK ?
Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ?
Sure our thing .
What sign ?
But Peter and Tony put all their paper in the basket a few moments ago . Now it's full .
Thank you for your directions . It's clear .
Now where should I pay the money ?
I ' Ve got a new boss .
It ' s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ' s very little evidence . It ' s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes , but I hope audience won ' t be too scared to go to the movie theatres !
Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ?
What ' s more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office !
5 days . From Feb . 13 to 18 .
He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities .
You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ' t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends .
I like to apologize for the problem . Please come down with your receipt and sweater to exchange it for the size you want .
I'd like to see the menu , please .
What are you going to do tomorrow ?
I would like for you to not be late for school .
I wonder if I could possibly borrow two bikes from the shop tomorrow ? I ' ll take actual care of them . I promise you .
Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y .
Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ?
I want to buy a ticket to Sydney tomorrow .
Step up onto the rail . Hold on . Keep your eyes closed . Trust me ?
Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .
As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about .
I ' m Chen Ming .
What dose she look like ?
Oh good we are almost there . The museum is round the corner from the Post Office .
I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please .
Does it happen often ?
What do you do for a living ?
I've got a sore throat , a runny nose and a headache .
That's good ! Just make sure to bathe them later .
Let's see if we can reach some sort of agreement over your curfew .
I don't understand why you would do that .
That ' s right , Ms . Bower . How are you ? I ' m not sure if I ' ll be able to fit you in this week , I ' m afraid .
He deserved it .
Ok , I don ' t want a mouse in our house . We have the tidiest house in the town .
Haven't you ever seen him working late ?
Good . Sorry to have troubled you so much , Miss .
Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer !
I don ' t see any problem ; only the car is a bit old .
We have a holiday next week , don't we ?
I'm not sure yet . Is there something you want to see ?
We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market .
Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child .
Hold on , please . Yes . you ' re booked on ZN741 to Atlanta on July 18th . Your seats are in the first class section .
Ok , I'll meet you at the club at two thirty .
Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes .
Also , are they allowing the apartment ?
Give me 10 yuan , your ID card and a photo of you please .
Have you ever climbed the mountain before ?
Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish .
do you think that there's life on other planets ?
That's true . Her husband is a fat cat .
No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home .
Yeah , I think so .
Oh , no .
Right now , I think I need to really focus on matters at home , but thanks for a nice evening .
Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ' t take them seriously .
Do you ever meditate or read before bedtime ?
Yes , great . I am happy you are coming .
I want my money back for the delivery .
The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages .
If I were you , I ' d buy that now while it ' s on sale . If you spend $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes .
Waiter ! May I see you for while ?
That ' s true . There ' s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ' s feeling and character .
Um ... Hello , I would like to open an account .
You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything .
No , but I do like jade bracelets .
I am sorry . That table has been booked .
That's a long time .
No , but is it possible for me to add channels later ?
I want a refund !
That ' s good . Is the location easily accessible ?
Well , I think you should go for our manger . I will call him here .
Hello , stewardess . Could you bring me a blanket ? I feel so cold .
Just go through the number eight to ticket barrier over there . A train will be in directly .
Yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm in China . Hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow !
I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ?
You would need to speak to Ms . Stevens .
Just whose fault is this damage ?
I strongly urge you to change your diet . You shouldn't eat too many desserts .
Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ?
Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .
What did happen ?
Is there anything else I can do for you ?
I ' m a large .
I am having an exam at nine , It's already eight thirty .
Then I will take your picture for your passport .
I wish I could find one just like it .
Yes , I will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later .
Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance .
I like that Kenmore refrigerator .
It's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loan me some cash until I get paid ?
Sounds as if you come from a professional family .
That sounds fine to me .
Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house . But I don't know where the best place to shop is . Can you give me some advice ?
Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ' t behave very well ?
Yes . At first sight .
But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
You should really drink water .
Good . Anything else ?
That's right . You should give it up , too . It's bad for your health .
Yes . Who are you looking for again ?
I don't know . Let me look on the rack . Here is one . LARGE . Try it on .
Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job .
That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank .
Have you any idea of the prices of ruby and diamond ?
Sometimes , if there's music playing .
What time's your flight ?
Hello , this is Peter Dixon from NEZ news radio . May I speak to Mr . Wilson please ?
He will be back at about seven o'clock .
It's been a full two years since we last saw each other .
Oh , hi , Mary , what can I do for you ?
London is such a historical city ! There ' s history everywhere you look . There ' s nelson ' s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ' s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 .
Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !
You're new at this , huh ?
I am , sir .
Oh I see . That ' s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ?
Well , that's too expensive . I can't afford that .
I ' ll stand in with you if you like . I ' Ve got nothing else to do .
We'll have to discuss it with my boss .
Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ?
Are apartments expensive in this city ?
In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
I thought you had grown out of such child practices .
Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off .
Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ?
No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother .
Yes . Which one is the latest ?
Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem .
What about my rights ?
It's hard to say . But I do love waltz very much .
I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something .
Here is my member card . Can I have someone carry those bags to my car ?
Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks .
Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit .
Does it always close at six ?
I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ?
Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank !
Shall we go for a drive today ?
Why ? We can leave school earlier that day .
Yes . I wanna know where I can get on the bus going downtown .
Have you had any publications ?
It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier .
Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work .
What's the occasion ? You won the lottery ?
I ' m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?
A haircut and a shave , please .
Excuse me , sir , could you please tell me the way to Aidan Bookstore ?
Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant .
Yes , I will . Thanks for your care .
It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How are you ?
It's a quarter to eight . I'm going to work .
No hurry ! I'II tell you now , The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , fans , mini-musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars ...
Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?
You did a good job for the company . So , this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ?
But what if I don't win what I bid on ?
120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ?
There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know .
You never guess she is going to have a baby .
She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper .
Did they go with the proposed counter-offer ?
All right , I'll walk to the village and I'll get some meat .
What size pan were you thinking of ?
I'm ready .
Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not .

That's $ 20 in all .
Yes , I ' d like to do that .
Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ' s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ' m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ' ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ' s cheaper . You don ' t like buying things online , do you ?
Are you going to make an offer today ?
Good morning , sir . Have a seat please .
It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup .
Thank you . I am glad that you are enjoying it .
I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up .
Just throw them away !
No . thanks . I'm full .

Could you give more detail information about some of the industries you just mentioned ?
Yes , let's go .
All right . I know a great restaurant near here . But , it's a little expensive and I don't have much money with me .

Hurry up , get in .
No , I wouldn't think so .
I'm trying to buy a new bedroom set .

Which room are you staying in now , sir ?

It was really nice talking to you also .
It's so named because in the pavilion over there the great poet Bai Buyi of the Tang Dynasty would take a rest after drinking a little too much , and watch the moon over the lake .

No problem , we have a short form right here ; just hand it to me when you are done .
I would like to make my plea .
Ok . But is there anything wrong ?

Not yet . I ' ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time you get here .
Yes . Which channel is for opera ?
I'm checking out in about half an hour .
What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ?
We can do that very easily .

I'll put the song at the front of the list .

Sixty cents a piece .
Why ? That ' s good news , but no one knows it ?
I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish .
No , some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment .
and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us .

Sure , what do you need to do there ?
6:30 . My room number is 305 .
Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience .

It's one of my favorite bakeries .

Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future .

Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us ?
Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ' re out the door . Half an hour , tops .
May I show you gold ones or platinum ones ?
Well , the way you drive , Jen ... I still don't think that's a good idea .
Who are we going to play with today ?
I was on a diet and exercised daily .
I am sure I'll enjoy some real chinese food then .
Next time you see him , please tell him I'm thinking of him .
Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us .

I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room .

Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts .
I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice .
Sure , why not ? I could use a rest .
What is its national anthem ?
I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table .
Yes , but he should bush it off as if it were not a big deal to him .
I think you are an excellent person . Honestly speaking , you are very suitable for this job
Oh , right . So , I can ' t quite follow what ' s going on ... who ' s winning ?
Hello again . What can I do for you today ?

In the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show .
It's $ 180 .

You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore .
Where are my shoes ?
Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .

Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee .
Going to the cafeteria ?
How much are you asking for every month ?
I think the starting salary for a salesperson is between 1,500 - 2,000 Yuan . But the specific number will be determined according to your sales .
No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system .
Oh ... I don ' t know .
Yes , five years ago . I began to work in a fashion company in Shanghai . Two years ago , I came to Beijing , and worked in a department store as a salesman .
Be careful !
It's ok . It seems we have a lot in common .
Let me see . Yes , you can have Room 313 . It's at the back .

Elvis Presley . Don't you recognize his voice ?

It ' s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first .
That ' s right . We ' ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ' t due to be finished until the end of the month , so we have plenty of time to get it done .
I think you should definitely apply for the position .
That ' s it , my lease is up . I have to move .
Hey ! Where are you going ... ?
Who's playing ?
So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
Yes . We ' Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .
That's fine , but do you have your receipt with you ?
Well , then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment .
Oh , no filet ? Okay , porterhouse will be fine then .
It sounds good , and how about its quality ? We only look for the best .
No , that ' s not all your fault .
You have to go and fix it .
Very Good . I will let him know as soon as he comes back . But , may I have your name , please ?

It's in a dungeon , under a castle .
It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them .
What about the interior ?
OK . How about some fried spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer !
Could I list my interests and special skills next ?
Here is my card .
No . That's all , I guess .
You ' ll only have to pay the initial fee .
This is how you turn on the computer .
I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ?
It ' ll just take me a moment to cancel your account .
I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
Don't mention it . Just a little thing I did .
Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now !

I'm on my way .
Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further .

I'm having a little trouble with this form .
Who has been here already this morning ?
Yeah . Last semester .
Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window .
well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass .
I broke my sister's mirror . I'm sure it'll get her back up . I really don't know how I can escape the punishment .
Do you have any idea how many you'd like ?
Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ?
Sorry , not before 10:30 .
Things happen ; make sure it doesn't become a habit .
I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ' m not a member now .
What kind of food will they be serving ?
Why not ? We're supposed to meet him there .
You can suck a candy or pinch your nose gently while breathing out . That shall help .

Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude .
I'm afraid our hotel is fully booked on that night . Is it possible for you to change your reservation date ?

Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules .
You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough .

Thank you for your kindness , ma'am . See you next Monday .
Yes , we are . Could we have the check please ?
That's a hard time . The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy .
Don't forget to call your host mother to tell her .
Of course You get a coupon for every 3 bags of sugar .
They always push the time . How many of them are over fifty ?

My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ?

I'll have to think about it .
Do I need to take a bus ?
I ' m hungry , let ' s grab a bite to eat .

Why not ? They are very fun and exiting .
It ' s easy enough . Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses .
You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ?

Really ? Where does he live now ?
I'll give you mine too .

All right . I'll have them .
What time do you usually go to bed ?

I need to find the cereal aisle .
That ' s ok , keep going , you ' re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ' t pound . That ' s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any other musician , your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship .
which one would you recommend ?
What street do I go to to catch it ?
Just some souvenirs .
The performance is excellent .
No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day .
I have all of that with me . I've also banked here for a number of years .
It began the night before last .
It includes a lot of useful words and phrases .

Thanks very much . I'm sure I'll be back , so see you again soon . Bye !
It might take a long time . Because there is a line , you know .
It's for the drinks .
Oh , it ' s almost eleven twenty .

Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ?
Anything wrong with it ?

How many courses do you have for this semester ?
Ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one .

Room service . May I help you ?

Well . You ' Ve come prepared . You have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ' s a simple transaction , and we can process it today .

Sure , Tuesday ' s perfect . May I ask where you ' re calling from ?
My uncle passed away last night .
No . My brother is playing football there .

Are you ready to order , sir ?
Yes , madam , can I help you ?
I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going .
Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church .

What's the price of the bread ?
If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet .

A bank was robbed this afternoon . A reporter on the scene covered the event , the live coverage reproduce the robbery to the live .
You've got to be joking .

But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year .
Then forgive her mistake .
The second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ?
How old is your phone ?
I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around .
Sure . I'd love to .
No problem , sir . We will arrange you a table for 5 .
I don't know . Maybe they are really crazy .
Pretty good . Listen ... have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue ?
Why would the person who told have problems with the law ?

Gate Four . Please go and have a seat in the waiting hall .
What did the woman ask you ?
Who's the booking for , please , madam ?
I haven't shopped there . How is the food ?
It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside . Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
Yes , but I want to go to the country .
Yes , I know . It ' s not the first time I ' m taking this ! Don ' t worry , I won ' t overdose !
If you have any question , you can ask me .

What else do I have to do ?
No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed .
Of course . First dial the code 011 to get an international line . Then you dial Taiwan's country code

I would like to check out these books .
Yes , we do . What kind of room would you like ?

I have a master's degree and I meet all the needs you want , so I am confident of doing this job well .
I can boil it , grill it , or microwave it .

Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it .

She is a nurse .

I received my bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2004 .
I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement .

the cost of living in London is just too high for most people .
Please go to receive optometry first over there .
It ' s unfair .
That's a good idea .
Of course to me .
Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit .
Really ? Well you ' ll have to get there before 6pm because they close early today .
my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time .
I like how clear the sky gets after it rains .
Where's Lisa ?
Speaking . Who's calling , please ?
Sure , it's multi-functional . Besides playing music , it can also be used to store documents and make recordings .
Well , thin is always " in " with the media .

Do you take credit card ?
I'm glad I asked you . So this is aisle 6 where I can find all the canned fruits and vegetables .
How about this one ? It is well-known for the effect of removing scurf .

Deal .

Ten thousand .
do you have any other questions ?
No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there .

That was easy !
You ' re unbearable , you can walk home , I ' m leaving .
I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous .
Sir , this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors .
Are you quite sure ?
No , I listened to the music , too .
How can we help him ?
What university would you enter ?
It is cute . I will take it . Please make out the receipt .
I can't remember .
We are going to buy our own house .
I'm sorry , but I can't go .

Can you change American dollars into French francs ?
Hello , is that Mr . Li ?
Hi , Boss ! I'd like to tell you what we've discussed during the day .
I'm afraid there is a bit of a problem . in fact , he has booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon .
how often do you usually cook ?
Excuse me ? Let's try to work this out , okay ?
It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ' t default on a payment !
Can you direct me to the elevator ?
I hate to tell you this , but we have no more filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ?

Okay . Everyone else's parents let them stay out until two or three in the morning .
Barbara . But please , just call me Barb .

What time would you like to leave ?
Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations !
$ 5000 and I want them all in fifties .
I wonder if I can ask you a question .
How's your time spent in the United States ?
Just call me Miao Dou , Please .
Yeah , me too ! What are you thinking you would like to do ?
Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .
It's really no problem .
Yes . Why not ?
I know he will , too .
In fact , could I ask you for the recipe ?
Fabulous . Thanks .
How many members were in your party in all ?
How about mah-jong ?
I think that a tip of $ 3 . 60 will be the right amount to leave .
Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
Hey ! What's up ?
After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family .
She'll be very happy with this . And how do you plan to pay for it ?

The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ?
Hi , Mary , long time no see .
Poor guy .

I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . A ten-year-old boy and a mother live upstairs . Maybe the boy is a little bit naughty .
I feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma .
My parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ' ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ?

The coupon can be used at least one year .
Would you like to have this kind of suitcase ?
And how long does the course last ?
You are absolutely right .
I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere !
It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done .
That's a problem .
What does she do ?
Do you like coffee , Ann ?
Hey , Anna , this is Jason .

About three days .
OK , sir . Here you are . There is a one-year warranty .
Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ?
I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control .
Oh , poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year .
Yes , we do .
Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me .
I can ' t find my purse . Have you seen it ?
Will you exfoliate the skin as well ?
For sure all the customers will benefit from this .
No need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans .
Oh I ' m enjoying myself but it ' s so hot here
I don't have a fever , and I'm ready for my test .
Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ?
Can you drive ?

I would like to find this book .
What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you !
OK , sir . I'll do my best .
Well , here's 3,000 yuan .
Well , that ' s the problem . We never seem to have ' typical ' days , but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer . There would also be a lot of telephone time , setting up appointment , and taking care of a lot of support work .
Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it .
And who is directing ?
Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ?
It wasn't as good as you think .
How many students are in the class ?
And do you want the glossy or matted finish ?
Certainly , sir . Would you sign here , please ? ... Thank you .
Is that you , Bob ?
There is , actually . If you can get your company to apply for a cheque from a bank in Shanghai , that'll speed things up no end .
Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ?
Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie .
Can you work part-time or full-time ?
Turn on the TV , please .
About David , No , I didn ' t hear anything .
Not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time .
Yes , I'd love to . It ' s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
Thanks . But it ' s necessary for me to buy a TV set .
Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly .

Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy .
It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside .
As a matter of fact , I have . I ran into him just the other day .
come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try .
definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ?
We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .
OK . You have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
I see , that's a long time . How much was the watch ?
I thought this was the emergency room .
Oooo ... gross ... you're sweating all over the place .
John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question .
What is my ideal weight ?
Dad , why are you taping the windows ?
See you tomorrow night .
Could you give me your name and phone number ?
I've known from your resume that you are a college graduate .
I ' m really jealous ! I won ' t be able to get any time off for at least another three or four months .
Susan is going to get a divorce .
Yes . What's the fare ?
Please pull your table down . It's lunch hour .
really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ?
You missed a court appearance .
Would you like anything else , sir ?
I see . How do they make testing and analysis of this item ?
how do you think you did ?
ok .
Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun !
Oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you .
Yes , I'd like to see that . What does it clean exactly ?
OK , I'll call ahead .
Yes , it's all taken care of .
I want egg soup .
I want to be a lawyer in the future and the Law School was one of the best schools in Harvard .
Oh , I see what you mean !
My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me .
Why don't you find someone who is in the know .
Why not ! I rolled a five . The category is Best Pictures .
Welcome to Lens Magic , ma ' am . How can I help you ?
What do you want to do in this company after five years ?
On and off , for quite a few years .
What a great idea .

okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game .
I'll pick a shampoo that's just right for your hair type . Sit right here , and rest your neck on the side of the sink . Is the water too hot ?
Not too well . He had to have four teeth pulled last week .
It's good . By the way , what kind of clothes do I have to bring with me ?
Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .
Not always . But they like good meal .
In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ?
Have you taken your temperature ?
You do ?
That's too little . Well , I'll come down to 120 yuan .
Really ? Great !
Oh , it ' s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week .
Your starting salary is 2500 yuan a month , and after you become a permanent employee , it will be higher .
Can you recommend a resort to me ?
May I buy a ticket here at the station ?
Well , I have the day off from work .
Well , that's a bit stiff . Do you have some cheaper ones ?
Let's just say I'll have it easy ...
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny .
I'll handle him . Now go home . I'll call you after work .
Really ? You don ' t look very Chinese to me , if you don ' t mind me saying so .
I ' m sorry that you didn ' t get in .
Oh , no . He ' s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers .
Good afternoon , what flights do you have from London to Paris ?
Stop burping .
Come on , John . This is my favorite show .
And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress .
Your total comes to $ 7 .
Yes , because I love yours .
Sure . Where are you ?
Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather .
If you could , would you please talk to him ?
In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever .
No . I can't wait . I feel awful . The dinner appointment has to be canceled .
Ha . There won't be a next time .
Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ' ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ...

Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ?
I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die .
I'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us .
Well , I don't think much about it . To me , it's a sheer waste of time
Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute .
Why don't you read the local newspaper ?
Oh , that scared me .
Yeah , but it's so hard . I have to work , and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby . I'm going to get sick at this rate .

To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single .
No , you can't do that .
Hi ! Ed , what's up ?
Some poisonous gas .
Great ! I'm having a great time .

Hi , I ' m Mary Smith .
Nice to meet you , I'm jim taylor .
The next beginning class starts on October 25th .
They're right upstairs .
It ' s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory .
Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips .
I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it .
It's on the 7th floor . As you get off the elevator , you'll see it on your left .
I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough . So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner . And I bought an American newspaper .
We should come here more often .
Yet Julia is not a patch on Anne because she's not as diligent and clever as Anne .
I go to Panda Express for my Chinese food .

Okay , I will take it into consideration .

It ' s ok . I ' ll call her back latter . Thank you .
I should have ?
Oh , no ! I ' m so sorry ! Are you all right ?
Which university did you graduate from ?
We'll remain open from 9 a . m . till 8 p . m .
Oh , maybe three years . I will study and get the master degree first . Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back .
When do you need it ?
Did you call for a car service
I will be sending someone out as soon as I can get hold of the roofer . Will you be home this morning ?
You forgot all about it , didn't you ?
don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go .
Would you tell me when we get there ?
Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal .
Only 350 yuan .
Oh , good . Why don ' t you take the bus to mine and we could play Mah Tiang ?
I voted this morning .
Have you invested in the stock market before ?
No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 .
How about 130 yuan ?
It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one .
Nice to meet you too . Let me help you with your bags .

Yes , that's her .
I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher .
Is it kept in hand now ?
It ' s expensive , too . Let ' s just sit in the sun and go swimming instead .
The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes .
Of course . First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth . You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper .
Excuse me , but I want a pair of mittens .
Yes , that will be easiest .
it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ?
Really ? I thought that they'd been killing us by now .
Do you have your library card ?
Yes . I'd like a hamburger and a large order of french fries , please .
Too bad you missed Jane's performance .
Sure . I didn ' t know you liked mysteries .
I'm going to Bill's house .
That's very good advice !
But your American ?
What do you think of our new teacher ?
Hello , Ms . Murphy ?
Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ?
Is Doctor Hawkins here ? She ' s our doctor . We called her from the car .
Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs . Vale ?
Of course . I have lots of best friends .
Maybe we can meet again sometime ?
How do I know if it's blown out ?
Thanks very much for your help , Li Lan . See you tomorrow .
I think you'd be perfect for this job . This company needs someone like you . When can you start working ?
The tape player doesn ' t work .
Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ?
Now we have to walk .
Take me to the airport , please .
Are you working under pressure ?
Yes , that ' s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London .
Yes , we met last year at a conference .
Does the final count the most ?
Good morning , Maintenance Department .
You come back here with me tomorrow , and it's my treat !
Yes , but it was many years ago .
Six thirty , tonight .
No , thanks . I'm fine . Did you have a nice holiday ?
Yes , the snow is fun .
Would you prefer to come in in the morning or the afternoon ?
Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online !
I must be there no later than 9:00 .
5 days . And could you send a bellboy to pick up my luggage ?
But I can't bear it , John .
Mom , are those tattoos on your brows ?
No , why should I ? I don ' t feel like it . Besides , I ' m in such a bad mood .
We're little further away from the street and traffic noise
It's no problem .
Would you like anything to drink with that ?
I think a medium one will do .
Of course I do !
I can't believe it , I had faith in Bob and he let me down .
We need a reservation for four .
Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie .
Do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm ?
Sure , Mum . In a minute .
I'll say . The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself .
I'm wearing my heavy jacket .
Speaking . What can I do for you ?
I am told that you dance like an animal . Why don ' t you give a show in the front stage ?
How's your brother doing ?
My date's very sophisticated , so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the best .
I had a wonderful evening .
In that case , we will need to fill out this paperwork . Do you have identification with you ?
Do you think you'll still love him when he is old and gray ?
Hi , what brings you to my office today ?
How do you pay for it ?
Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school .
Good afternoon , sales department . May I help you ?
Is there a bus tour ?
OK , please fill in the form first .
But what if he knows my name , where I live ...
So now your bill comes to £ 20 . 15 and I need to pay £ 22 . 50 .
so , you're into 80s music then ?
sure , what's on ?
I wish he could too .
Your passport will be ready in a few weeks .
What flight has seats available to Milan on this Sunday ?
our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .
Not really . There aren ' t any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I ' ll go to them .
Sure . It's 5:10 PM .
Hey , Doug ! How ' d it go at that meeting yesterday ? I know you were pretty anxious about it .
What would you like to drink ?
Taxi ! Taxi !
Hold on please ... Yes , you are booked already .
What an idea !
Have you called to inquire about the positions ?
I was thinking of pizza .
Yes , I know . But I don't mind working hard .
I ' m mixing the sauce . It ' s my speciality . I make it according to my own secret recipe .
Very affordable sir . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
It's our anniversary today . I am looking for the same flowers as the ones in her wedding bouquet .
At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays .
I have a major stomachache
It lasts for 9 months .
You ' re working there this year ?
Yes . It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality . You certainly have an eye for good things .
Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?
I'll speak to Bob , he'll be able to help us .
Oh , there is something wrong with my car .
I think she is really going to like her teacher though .
About a pack , more if I drink .
What is your greatest strength ?
Well , that's your uncle Bill , his wife and two of their daughters .
Turn the chair I can see myself in the mirror .
Yes , I can speak Spanish , and I can also speak Chinese .
Your parcel weights 420 grams . So it is 21 . 3 dollars by air , or 6 . 9 dollars by sea .
I ' m fine . Thanks for asking .
We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
What do you mean too late ?
What about this one ?
Hold on a second , please . I'll see if he's in . I'm sorry , Mr . Baker had just gone out . Who's calling ?
Relax , it was just a goat !
I have a yoga class tomorrow . Do you want to come with me ?
I will be back again next Wednesday .
I'm sorry to tell you that I have to cancel our appointment .
Well , my flight leaves at 8 a . m . , and I'll arrive at 10 a . m . Shall we say 11 o'clock ?
How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise ?
I know you didn't .
I like to listen to Rock and R & B .
What would you do ?
Capsules are fine .
No trouble at all .
These are my roses . The roses have been in flower for a week .
I remember now . Your advice is very helpful .
Mark Wyatt ? I am sorry . The line is terrible . Could you spell that for me , please ?
I ' m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further .
What is your policy on returns ?
so nice to see you again , Louise . How are you doing ?
No , thanks . I already took some medicine .
My load isn't that big .
What kind of family are you like ?
He was quite right .
Thank you . It looks very attractive .
Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ?
Are you ready ? Here we go . Say Cheese !
No , that's it , thank you .
Five days a week , too ?
It feels like there's going to be rain later .
I understand . Would you like me to call you back ?
I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ...
Of course , that's all part of the service .
Why not go to see the doctor ?
what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips !
Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ?
I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture .
Ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .
First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account .
Am I standing the right way ?
We may come at 6:30 p . m .
Good afternoon , Miss Li .
I ' m glad you could make it .
Happy birthday ! Many happy returns ( of the day ) .
It's too bad . They are very delicious .
Yes , I see it listed on the printout we got off of the Internet .
Really ? Does Mary know that ?
Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study !
O . K . , John . Well , can I have a look at the place ?
I think so . I think you'd better make a phone call to see whether there is a table available .
It should be on the shelf , but I didn ' t see it .
I really envy you , Danny .
You can take any bus except the Number 9 .
that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help .
Yes , I got married to a man that I met shortly after I divorced my first husband .
How much shall I pay ?
But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls .
Well , I want to extend it for 2 more nights .
Sounds like you are really getting in shape !
Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it .
I don't know . I feel like going out .
I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays .
Let me check if we have any vacancies ... You ' re in luck . We have one single room available .
In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ?
How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you .
I'll get on that right away !
It is only a pin prick . I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find .
Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ?
oh , well , that's just a few minutes walk to my office , come around and see me now .
I would like to make a suggestion then , sir .
Good morning , Miss . Are there boat tickets to Miami on the first of September
What's the score ?
I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous .
It's hot .
Yes , Miss Parks ? How may I help you ?
I ' m all right with that .
I follow you and I'll take three just for my trial .
My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
No need . I have only this small handbag with me .
Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods .
OK . By the way , I would like to have this sweater washed by hand in cold water . It might shrink otherwise .
I want to pay all of it off today .
Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago .
Thank you for pointing that out . I mistakenly gave you your friend's breakfast .
What's the matter here ?
No , not at all . Glad to have you .
It just won't connect to a webpage , but it will pop up .
We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton .
When can I move into my new house ?
Would you like to register now ?
Could you pass me the jacket with wide lapels ?
3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep .
How about 12:45 ?
Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher .
Oh , sorry to have bothered you .
It's fantastic !
I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen .
I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too .
I think that we should have just the sub-committee .
I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
Yes , It is the right one .
Yes . I have switched it on for a long time . The room is still very cold .
I am very active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving them half done .
I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family .
All right . Here you go .
I had to . I was missing you a lot .
I was scared stiff of giving my first performance .
This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !
OK . But which size should I use ?
I am sorry , I didn ' t catch what you said . Could you repeat it please ?
What do you plan on making as a side dish for dinner ?
Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ?
how ' s that ?
Thank you very much . See you tomorrow afternoon .
That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat !
Your assistant said that it was time to come in and sign my escrow papers .
I was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms .
Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ?
It must be my special touch . I think bargaining is in my blood !
Whenever you're ready to check out , I'll be ready , sir .
Ok , I ' ll take a return ticket on the soft sleeper please .
Daniel , here is some money for the tickets .
What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ?
What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good .
Yes , I do . Who are your financial backers ? Who are the key competitors ? Does the company have a plan for the IPO ? What would you say is the best thing about your product or service ?
Oh , excellent . How much does it cost ?
Is your boss Chinese ?
Yes , I got a job as a Management Trainee .
It ' s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild .
That's true . Many people from the south don't like the weather here .
Do you like it here so far ?
Though our company doesn ' t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ' t think the boss will like us to do that .
Thank you ... Excuse me , sir . You forgot to fill in your visa number .
Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job . We ' ll be getting back to you .
I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box .
Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth .
I have enough time . I just can ' t seem to fall asleep and stay asleep .
What's new with you ?
All right . Can I pay with credit cards ?
what did you in mind ?
Well , you know I studied marketing in America . So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team .
Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution .
Thank you very much for your invitation .
One moment , please , and I will connect your call .
how are you doing ?
I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades .
No , I feel young , fresh and energetic .
What degree did you get ?
As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ' ll be able to meet our requirements .
No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves . Thev ' re so smart .
do you understand what duties that job would entail ?
Fine , thanks . How are you ?
Yes , it should be so . Then we should write the body and in the body we should mention the place where we saw the job advertisement .
We should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview .
I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved . My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
Come on . Tell me what happened .
That's all right . I hope we can help you at some other time . Good-bye .
At 10:20
Why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? We also have lipstick to go with it .
Sure , honey . I'll read you a bed time story , too .
How many people are there in your family ?
I have a sore throat and headache .
This is Mr . Smith .
I'm much better . The stomachache is gone , and the doctor is about to give me another endoscope examination to see whether the ulcer has healed .
Can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student ?
You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school .
Now that's a great plan . It's a date !
Oh . I like this one . I have been looking for this color and design . Please wrap it for me , and I ' ll take it .
Okay , I'll take it out front right now .
Don't worry , sir . I think it's a seller's market right now . Let me get down some information about your apartment first . what is your property's address ?
Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic . It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this . But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change .
Am I back in your good books ?
But it still hurts . I thought I loved him .

I need to be motivated , Vince . Multi - motivated . As in multi-million .
Hello , is John in ?
When you go dinner with John , who foots the bill ?
Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left . Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money ?
Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out .
I know . But at that time your blame is rubbing salt into his wounds .

Two bottles of white wine , please .
Let's go to Julian Store .

Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate .
How many diners will be in your group ?
Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant .
It ' s about 7 o ' clock . let ' s have our breakfast first .
I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu .
In my opinion , it has a broad prospect and it needs smart mind .
Maybe I can help .
It is . You must be new here . I do my shopping here regularly , once a week .
I think it's my ankle .
There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure .

All right . Welcome back anytime .
Yes . The price differs depending on how many you want .
Tu Mao , I'm hungry , let's get something to eat .
You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not .
Can you get recommendations from your present employers ?
When did you change your mind ?
Thank you very much .
Hi , I'm here to check in .
Alright , let's go .
You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ?
more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners .
You're going go Dresden for sightseeing ?
Certainly .

I would've thought that somebody would have told you .
Spring is a lively season .

I thought he only liked to listen ?
Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off .

The fruit and vegetables are over there .

I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess .
I ' m concerned about your lack of marketing experience and , frankly , your age , you ' re pretty new at all this .
I thought you were making dinner tonight .
Where did you go there .
Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself .
look ! they've taken your fur coat too .
Do not mention it .
Right ... anything else ?
You don't look well at all . Are you sick ?
so , how's your course going ? Do you like it ?
Gee ! You scared me !
I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now .
I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition .
The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales .

That ' s more like it !

You are not serious ?
Yes . I ' d like to obtain a master ' s degree in international relations .
Sure . I ' d like to see how it washes .
There's a bag in the bathroom . Just put your laundry in it .
Don't believe him . He ' s a liar .
We're coming .
Oh , am I seeing Mr . Li ?
I only wanted to help him .
Will there be any extra charge ?
Yeah , more people need to take public transportation or carpool .
Good morning , how are you doing today ?
Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home !
Anything's all right with me . I'm not particular about soups .
Good game ?
Hi . Mike .
Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make .
Um ... do you think we can make a pit stop ?
Let's have lunch together today .
Yes . I think so . It ' s not a very expensive apartment . It ' s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too .
About 300 a month .
I told you to get this consignment out last week . We can't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs , can we ? What am I going to do with you ?
She sure knows how to strut her stuff .
Well , doctors are such an important job . I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got , isn't it ? I want to be important and help people .
Yes , please tell her I stopped by .
No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' .
What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired .
Only as a clerk in a store .
Alright . Alright .
We ' re having a lot of trouble with our printer . Could you come and take a look at it sometime this afternoon ?
Don ' t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ' t be so bad ...
I want to make a reservation under the name of William Smith .
Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ?
No , I don't like short hair . I like this one . The wave looks beautiful , and it fits my age too .
How many of you ?
OK . But let me park my car in a better position . All right , miss . Where are the bags ?
Is that Room service ?
Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox .
I suspect it's unavoidable .
That'll be great .
Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field .
We may go abroad . I ' m not sure . My wife wants to go to Egypt . I ' d like to go there , too . We can ' t make up our minds .
I think you should buy a bottle of moisturizer .
Have you worked in a computer company before ?
It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps .
Sweet . Can you tell me where it is ?
Thanks . I'll let him know .
Mom , I finished .
Have you ever been tested for allergies ?
Absolutely . And it's a good way to kill time during the tour .
That ' s right . Drive back to the traffic rights and turn right . Follow the road for about a mile , until you see the plaza hotel . It ' s a really big hotel . You can ' t miss it . Turn left at the hotel .
I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home .
Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?
Never mind . It ' ll be over in 10 minutes .
Not too good , I'm sorry .
We have a selection of orange , apple , grape and lemonade .
I would like to get some meat today .
I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ' ll have to give me some more information .
When pigs fly !
you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time !
Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ?
No , this is a focus-free camera . All you have to do is point and press the button .
I ' ll leave at ten o ' clock .
Ok , count me in .
Oh , the policeman's coming .
Which day would suit you ?
Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault .
What kind of music do you enjoy listening to ?
Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ?
So , do you want to go somewhere for dinner and practice our English together tonight ?
Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .
Thank you . That's very nice of you .
Wow , talk about job perks ! That's great . I would like to do something exciting like that . But I am only an accountant . Not too much excitement there . huh ?
It's for fun . And also , the apples here are Green Food .
Yeah , I want the note .
That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ?
I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management .
Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us .
A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ?
Do you want an IBM-compatible PC or a Macintosh ?
That sounds interesting ! I'll send a fax . As soon as I receive the definite answer , I'll give you a special answer .
Will the utilities be turned on ?
Yes , that would make a good ending for your resume .
That ' s crazy !
Hello , this is Li King . Can I talk to your manager ?
How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter !
Thank you very much , Mr Green .
That's exactly what I think too .
I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever .
What do you think of your present job ?
I envy her and also I hate her at the same time .
You are a smart girl !
Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ?
What do you think of it ?
Anything important happened ?
I'm thinking of taking his class next semester .
I see . I'll bring some to-go boxes for you .
Sorry , he's out .
Don ' t you know Christmas is coming ? I have a lot of things to get ready .
Will you look at this form ?
And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided .
Can you believe the headlines ?
I have all the information in this folder .
And where's the elevator ?
I don't think this is fresh .
Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner .
Oh , it wants me to put in my PIN number . OK , I can do that ...
Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go .
Hi , I'm Josephine Chen , the tour guide for the Jade Agency . We have a reservation of twenty rooms for tonight .
Good . Go on , please .
Tell me what you want to eat .
Where is your domicile ?
Sure . Here you are . Attach the label to your luggage and put your bag here .
Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company .
First of all , you should pay attention to what you eat . Don't eat too much food with high calories , such as chocolate , ice cream and the like .
You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art .
Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened .
Hello , are you Muriel Douglas ?
The last one clockwise .
Let's see what we'll take .
Sure that ' s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ?
I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ' re famous , so everyone loves them .
I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago .
Excuse me , Sir , May I have the time , please ?
Professor wang can I ask a few questions ?
Well , I thought it was $ 83 .
Yes , you like them very much . right ?
I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better . Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to .
No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition .
...
I suppose they're playing games .
It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there .
Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !
I just bought a new atlas . I ' m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ' s a vast country .
Sure I will get to do that right now .
We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it .
Double rooms with twin beds .
Mr . Anderson , the boss wants to see you .
I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .
He came to work late every day that week . Then on Friday , he didn't show up at all .
Yeah , but so what ! I ' m proud to live in the world ' s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too .
Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ?
Charge . Here's my card .
$ 15 . And for a hard one , only $ 6 .
Where'd you get the ticket at ?
I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer .
I loved PCC .
I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree .
You're late .
I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ?
I really want to make a salad .
fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life !
No , I just started working here at IBM , I am assigned sale department .
Don ' t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy .
And how long do those take ?
Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount furniture store .
Yes , I'd like to book a table for two this evening .
If necessary , I can stay here to accompany you until you are discharged .
I got the ticket in front of my apartment .
Glad to hear that . Generally , it is 2 to 3 hours more than your working hours .
Ms . : Do you have a question , Mary ?
I traveled the Three Gorges .
I need one full set of sheets in King-size .
They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes !
What ' s the postage on this letter to hongkong , please ?
Do you have the receipt with you ?
Well , I'm not so sure . Most of my make-up is brown .
What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here !
Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back .
Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes .
Trust me .
What was it for ?
I wish I had a dog . My cat can't do any tricks .
Oh , that's good . We will come to our final decision based on your credit rating , the payment capability ...
I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question !
Let me see a doctor .
For what ?
Are you a doctor ?
It works if you keep at it . Come on , let's go !
I really like the book you lent me the other day .
We have an hour-long lunch break from twelve to one . We can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn't mind , as long as we get our work done on time .
No , PLS post the bill to 124 Hildrod Lane , Milton County , 98830 .
Oh , I haven ' t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time .
Not at all , Sam .
I know that I should learn how to save more , but I hope that we can spend a little on ourselves sometimes .
Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo .
OK . Oh , how much do you make at your current job , if you don ' t mind my asking ?
That ' s fine . I'll have a try .
Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me .
Do you have any sales experience ?
I bashed it against the chair in my room .
What kind of software can you use skillfully ?
Yes ! Thank goodness you ' re here . These bugs are driving us crazy !
I'm really sorry , I'll bring you a hot one right away .
Hello . This is the operator . Can I speak to Mr . Smith , please ?
He doesn ' t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon .
I haven't met the Smiths for a long time .
Oh . This is Paul . When will he be back ?
Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation .
I think that one fits you . Do you need insurance ?
How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own ?
It's at 7:30 a . m .
Well , it is different in different countries . But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal .
Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ' s not very l
Visual C + + , C and Delphi .
But somebody told me this was the right bus to take . I want to go to Tian'anmen Square , you see .
For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ?
Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ?
Yeah . Here ' s my list . I ' m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though .
Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months .
Do you want to work part-time or full-time ?
to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were
Are you doing different fundraisers ?
But all the evidence points to you .
How about if I pay $ 850 ?
Well . Didn ' t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there .
Yeah . But it's fun . Look at those two ugly old ladies ... or are they men ?
When these papers get processed , the house will be yours !
No , I'm here all by myself .
Can you tell him that it ' s urgent ?
Wow , the view from the peak is so grand !
All right . What time are you coming ?
By the way , I'd like to change some U . S . dollars to pounds and I want to know today's exchange rate .
I do . And now I'm working hard to learn English , and I want to be an interpreter some day .
We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan .
' Round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms .
Hello , can I start you off with anything to drink ?
And you ' re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ?
But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president .
I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how .
You can say that again . The government must open it ' s eyes to the fact .
I got a promotion . Lunch is on me .
800 yuan a month .
I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others .
Wow , that much ? Don't they have any public courses ?
How do you think people get their personalities ?
How about 60 % for the first load , then 20 % each ?
Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ' t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval .
Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .
It's ZN741 to Atlanta on July 1st .
It must be very demanding .
Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ?
The Redskin ' s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ' re losing again .
Yes , Ms . Ross ? What do you need ?
It ' s too bad that you have to leave so early .
Oh , that ' s a nice idea . Well , it ' s fine if you take our picture .
Sure . The fitting room is over there .
Yes , it's OK .
It's a bit of a problem situation , actually ... you see , our company has a Corporate Account with you , but unfortunately , we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently .
I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time .
In that case , I'm fit for the position I think .
Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red .
New York Airport . May I help you ?
Bye-bye !
The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational .
Tim , please . Please be seated .
It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty . Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle . But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier .
Ok , you could try the Peking wonton then .
I usually watch a lot of television before I go to bed . Maybe I should try something else to help me quiet down .
It's Lin . It's spelled L-I-N .
It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors .
Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ?
Mom ! ? ? ?
I've never thought about it like that before .
I'd like to reserve a table for three this evening .
At least you ' re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family .
It ' ll take about 20 minutes .
I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations .
Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .
I'm sorry , Steven .
The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills .
I talked to them probably about two weeks ago . Yeah , everything is going well .
Don't worry about it , Lin . That ' s no big deal . You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter . Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ?
yes , but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement .
Can I ask you a question ?
What do you mean ? What happened ?
Yes . Natural pearls or cultured pearls ? We have both kinds .
Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ?
Yes , I think so .
I ' m not sure , but in the meantime we will freeze these charges .
Great ! Thank you very much .
Oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ?
It doesn't matter . Bye-bye !
I prefer glossy . How much ?
That is a good idea .
Who's calling ?
Let me see . That is no problem . I'll see you then .
Watch out , Patrick !
Well , they're on sale today for only $ 1 each .
OK ! Come this way please . You should fill a form here first . Here you are .
it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet .
Hi ! Nicole !

Excuse me , is this the way to the Great Wall ?
It's okay .
I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together .

No . Thank you .

I'll put all that into the bag for you .
Could I change these pounds for dollars , please ?
What did you get yourself into ?

Crazy ! He locked himself in the room .

Nice to meet you ! My name is Peter Smith .

No , less than that . One and a half teaspoonfuls please . That's enough for me . That was very nice .
You would be using a lot of English in this job . Can you manage English conversation ?
My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot of paperwork , doesn't it ?

Have you made up your mind ?
Here you are . Seventy-five cents , please .
the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ?
Your grade will not be a surprise ; you will know what you need to work on .

This blouse is a special offer today . You can have it at 10 % off the regular price .

You have to . It is sure .

In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off .
well , sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . You ' d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way .

no , there's no double six at the of the number . It's just zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , six , double eight .
When ' s the big day ?
I ' m new here and I can ' t seem to find the lunch room .
Who is Ms Von ?
Well , you should try my store . The prices are good .
I'm sorry . I forgot to show you the lid . It comes with the pan .
You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?
Mothers like that .
No , not that much . And yes , that ' fine .
We don ' t have enough cash , but I ' ll take my credit card .
Yes , of course . The balance sheet contains 3 major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity .
Glad to meet you .
actually , I do . I took quite a few photography classes at University .
Do I have training opportunities ?
You said it . No one can match Shakespeare in artistic talent .
How can I help you today ?
OK ... Now how can I help , hon ?
Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us .
No , I'm proficient in both written and spoken English , but I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
I'll go and quit my job in the ABC Company .
You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour .
Show me your passport , please .
Yes , it's very lightweight . But I don't want this aluminum handle .
I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it .
Once a week .
Is it a long ride ?
Not me . You know money always burns a hole in my pocket .
Are you going home now ?
Why ? What was it about ?
Would you like me to try another card ?
Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
So this is a family business .
I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness .
Really ? I ' ll take it then .
I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore .
Oh , I think I broke my leg .
His new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air .
These postcards are great . I want to buy a dozen with different pictures .

I ' m reporting from Channel 5 News .
Do your think I should wear a different dress ?
It looks like our company trip will have to be canceled because of the typhoon .
Would you like these supplies delivered or would you like to pick them up ?
Good afternoon . What can I help you with today ?
How do I use the eye-drop and ointment ?
This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business
Could you baby-sit for me tonight ?
Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out .
They are short , I guess . About the same height as those short flowers over there .
What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen .
It does not work very well .
It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air .
I had a look yesterday . I found some exhibits are fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I have gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I have got some idea of your exports . I am interested in your silk blouses .
We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees .
They're both very well , thanks .

A trim and perm .
Well , I got laid off , and I ' m looking for work .
I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan . Do you know that ?
Where are you employed ?
It's nice , but still too expensive . Can you give me a 20 % discount ?
Where can we go to get both ?
How do you think about her ?
oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange .
Just like in the States ! That's perfect !
Mary , this is your homeroom . It's 213 . Remember that .
For What ?
Well , I don't like it , but I guess I don't have any choice .
This is room 504 . The room is so cold .
I prefer to learn English . In my opinion , English is easier than Chinese .
I just got sacked .
Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team .
Please , call my John . Well , there ' s a subway stop and bus station just around the corner . Do you have children ?
Well , they're really beautiful people .
But I think they're dull , aren't they ?
That's everything .
Thank you . Bye .
That's the beauty of the service ; they can deal with everything , with total security .
That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !
Your doctor will call you in a few days with the results .
I'm afraid we don't . Won't an English edition do ?
Is it the final price ?
Well , I guess we ' ll just have to wait and see .
I'm in the electrical appliances .
The rest of us will have this today's special , please .
Would you like any cash back ?
When you told your mom you would be home around 2 am , She must have a cow !
maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make
Hello , Janet .
Were you able to get a look at this person's face ?
do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
I am doing well . How about you , Mary ?
Of course . It ' s a terrible night , isn ' t it ?
It's almost time to get aboard .
Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends .
Could you please reserve it for me ?
My name is Jessica . What's yours ?
I'm sure you have the wrong number . This one has been my number for more than 20 years .
What do you think of the ending ?
What went down ?
Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing .
ok , i choose luckies .
Are you from America ?
To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !
Did she ? That ' s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
Don't drive too fast .
how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them .
Oh , what ' s the matter ?
Can you tell me about the other class ?
OK , I'll have Mr . Baker call you as soon as he comes back .
Would you go to the bookstore with me ?
Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ?
I feel sorry , but that's the decision of the directorate .
Yes , almost once a week .
Medicine .
Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days .
And how about your Spanish ?
What a beautiful sweater !
I think it ' s good , and it suits me , because I'm not good at cooking . Is it expensive ?
Mr . Reynolds ? Rick Murphy . I ' m the accounting manager for Macmillan and Emory , Incorporated .
How is the new product ?
Good afternoon , madam . May I help you ?
All right . Will you wrap it for me ?
Let's cross here .
Yes , and it is 37 ° C .
What does it included ?
Let ' s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ?
And the sinks don't seem to leak .
Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor .
I'm not sure , but we can find out . I bought some crosswords to keep him busy .
I need to pay my bills .
Good morning , Mrs . Smith .
Hello , Mr . Clark . You ' re early for lunch . It ' s only eleven o ' clock .
You don't know ?
Yeah , you've got it . Do you want me to show you the way ?
You've got it . Tell me a little bit about what you might be wanted .
What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it .
Is there something wrong ? You look so sad .
Whatever . You know , I ' m thinking of a gift for my mother . It ' s her 60 birthday next Friday . Could you give me some advice ? You are the expert .
I can ' t make a decision . You ' ll have to put forward an idea .
I'm sorry . Is that bicycle yours ?
We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me .
I hope so , too .
That's my cousin Hubert . He likes smiling .
My computer shows that you have a bench warrant .
Card number ?
He appeals to the fans thanks to two things
It ' s a letter from NYU .
Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine .
Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points !
But this time I ' m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ' m going to be a new man in one year ' s time !
Darned right I would !
You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us !
Yes , she gets along with them quite well .
I've already got your certificate for sick leave . How do you feel today ?
Beautifully done , many thanks .
That seems like a good idea , it's for wages , you see .
do you have a favorite band ?
I think the valve is faulty . I couldn't regulate the pressure and the seal burst . I tried opening the emergency valve but it was jammed .
That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply
Tom , we are in the restaurant now !
Is a blood test painful ?
There is a leaking pipe in my wall .
When does the next plane leave ?
That's what I did .
Let ' s drive off this road .
Your project made much profit for the company . And the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .
Well , what about it ? As it happens I've got two tickets for next thursday evening . I thought perhaps .
Yes ? What can I do for you ?
Here is 50 yuan .
Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then .
Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it .
It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway .
Yeah , yeah , we ' re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ' re there to show the government that we don ' t like the way that they ' re spending our tax dollars !
Do you have a problem with your account ?
I know them . They are the two brothers living next door .
I was wondering whether you could ship the tennis racket overseas to Taiwan .
Well , could you drive me home ? I have spare keys there .
Two weeks of paid vacation in your first year of employment . You ' re also eligible for medical and dental insurance . And we offer a generous retirement pension plan after 10 years of service . Do you have any other questions ?
I have been using the store across town for years .
I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else .
It ' s really unimaginable . The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language , but the driver took it on the chin .
I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client .
That girl was my cousin .
Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .
It's on telemarketing .
Curse this oven ! Curse it !
To tell the truth , I don't like it .
You'd better tuck in your shirt .
No problem , anytime .
Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you !
Thanks . I can wait here .
I'd be glad to .
Wait a moment . It seems that your letter is overweight . Let me weight it .
Let ' s see how your grades are this semester , and maybe I ' ll talk to your father about it .
Would you like to come ?
Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have .
All the food smells tasty today and makes my mouth water .
Good idea . We can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning .
A taxi will be here in just a minute , sir .
Great ! Thank you !
Enjoy yourself , sir .
Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ' ll go take an oatmeal bath .
Certainly , madam . I'll just check what we have available . . . Yes , we have a room on the 4th floor with a really splendid view .
I like spring , too . We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air .
Hello , Mr . lie . I would like to discuss with you the feasibilities of establishing a joint venture with your company .
Of course we have . It's on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month .
Oh , God . I've almost forgotten . I'll get it done right away .
Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now .
Thanks . I understand what to do now .
I'm sorry , but it's time for you to get ready for school .
I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication . He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field . Maybe he could help get things on track .
I left the job because of expiry of my employment contract . Besides I have accumulated a lot of experience in this sort of job . I want to seek better jobs .
We'll get the factory to meet your requirements .
7:30 . By tho way , I would like a table next to the window .
I know , but you deserve it .
No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you .
This is the receipt , please keep it . Have a good day .
So do I . This is Broadway . There are lots of theaters . This way leads to Times Square .
The chicken breasts are $ 4 . 05 a pound .

Not too much . I'm looking to rent an apartment .
I was wondering when trash collection day was .
Really ? I thought I was doing well .
Lucky for you , this month we aren ' t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ' ll throw in this pen drive !
Yes , I have seen those spots .
I'd love to , but I'm afraid I can't .
Happy Anniversary , honey .
If that ' s the case , then why did you leave ?
His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir .
It surely is .
She's speaking French , not Greek .
I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside .
Mmm .
No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 .
Well , you ' d better get some rest .
I ' d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now .
There ' s so much I want to do . I ' Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download .
I'm afraid I can't .
They're all here .
It starts at 11AM in the morning .
Economy , business class or first class ticket ?
Thanks a lot . I'll tell him .
The shoulder .
Yes , I am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam .
the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap .
Well , that depends . Tell me where you want to go ?
Great . Will that be cash or charge ?
I really like the record you lent me the other day .
Mom , I'm ready for school .
Hi Vicky .
Really ? You were so happy then .
I can't see a problem . Let's give it a try .
Really ? Please get it for me .
Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard .
Yes . So what else to do now ?
Sure , no problem . Can we fix a time to talk later ?
Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown .
Have a good time !
Here is your bill . It's $ 60 .
Mary , besides the resume , I think we should also write an application letter .
My stress level is pretty much what is usually is .
It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .
Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right .
If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here .
It quite suits me . I am free in the evening these days , I will have no difficulty starting at five pm .
she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be .
It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music . The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock . What was that bar called ?
I'll appreciate it if it could be arranged .
I see . Now I want to check out two books on spoken English . Can you show me where I can find them ?
no way . I will be scared out of my wits .
Show me some classic high heels , please .
This can't be the right stop .
I want to get a snack at the cafeteria .
Providence , Rhode Island . do you know it ?
Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ?
That's very considerate of you . May I have my bill ?
Oh , don ' t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It ' s really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long .
Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big . I think I could get lost if I went there alone .
Did you watch TV last night , Rose ?
Yes , before you start your training , they will test you on your English first .
Front desk , can I help you ?
And how well can you speak them ?
Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ?
Guess what ?
Twenty minutes ' walk at most .
You could always take the 264 .
Traffic rules are different among countries .
Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail .
I couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail . I probably fell down fifty times .

I don ' t know what happened to me . I just lost it .
Yes . It will keep your face from getting dry and make your skin soft .
Mom , please . Can I have a pet dog like Andy's ?
That was a thirtieth birthday present . You can have it if you want .
Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie !
Party of two ?
Me ? I ' m even less experienced than you are .
Children needing special instruction . Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools , and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education .
You should try other fundraisers .
Really ? Thank you . I am thinking the same thing about you .
Hello , Kate ! How are you doing ?
You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use .
Wonderful . I ' d like to know why you ' re interested in this position at our paper .
I'd like some toast and chicken wings .
The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company .
Yeah , this is the latest model . If you like it , you can try it on .
I have had disagreement with every director . I ' Ve worked with . We ' Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ' t know where rumours of my disagreement with Rachel Kelly come from . We got on very well and I hope to work with her again . I enjoyed making the movie very much .
No . I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ?
I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .

During that horrible rainstorm last night , my roof began to leak .
Certainly . It matches your suit perfectly .
Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat .
Is your watch right ?
You have a lot of plants .
That's good news . What stage are you at now ?
Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ?
A week or ten days . We'd like to have a quiet room , if possible-not too near the street .
May I have your name card ? I am always concerned about the newest computer .
not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ' s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo
do you feel ok ?
After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ' s company . It really doesn ' t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ?
Ok , I'll wait for you at 7pm at home . Anything else ?
Very quiet and safe . And it ' s got a lot of trees and plants .
Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way .
I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations . You know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy .

Yes , it's most irritating .
How about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them .
What kind of currency do you want ?
Yes . They are over there .
Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything .
And then what did happen ?
I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ?
I don ' t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ' s cheap and easy to use .
Light music and classic music .
For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
Me , too .
Why ?
So people can go and root for their old school team ?
the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ?
Have you had any kind of punishment in your college ?
We've particularly busy on Sunday . Please sit here . How do you wish it cut ?
Could you explain what you saw ?
Yes , we are a small family business .
Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again !
Looks good . I'll take it .
We need the best possible quality .
Where's the new house ? Is it far from here ?
yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ?
I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you .
Next time you are in Shanghai , please let me know , and let me be of some assistance to you .
Goodbye .
yes it is . Residents can queen up in the lines to my right .
Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something .
What can I do for you ?
Www , man !
Why ? What time is it ?
Not really !
Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion .
Please fill out the table .
Hello , Mr David Richton , this is Min Wang calling from network , i am calling about the reporter position you advertised on the internet .
What about your mother ? Did she help you ?
This doesn ' t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is .
Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy .
But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ' t got the real facts .
Daisy ' s in hospital too . She god food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood .
The principal just announced that Dr . Smith is going to take over as dean of our department .
I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB .
We can ' t really ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ?
I think we should begin the letter with a salutation , and the salutation must be very formal .
Is it chicken ?

Thanks for telling me .

Really ? The day after tomorrow ? That's very soon .
Did you understand question number three ?
Do you really think so ?
I prefer a package tour , and we don't have to worry about accommodation , meals or that sort of trivial demanding things .
Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn ' t have !
Waiter , bill , please .
Is it waterproof ?
No can do ... sorry .
Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant .
Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ?
Come in please .
The government will never fulfill their promise .
I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ' s the end of the year .
That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
I wish you wouldn't play the TV so loud .
Well , humans could never make something like that .
Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son .
Well , you are over at the law school . So I wondered if you would mind coming with me when we talk to Ms . Connors . We ' re supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight .
Oh , sorry . I don't like them . Why not ask Lily . She likes modern dance .
Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ' t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ?
That's alright .
What ' s the hurry ?
On this occasion , most people do .
One dollar to five francs . Is that all right ?
How do you do ? I'm Ted Nugent .
Wine , please .
Hello . I'm answering the ad in the paper about your car . And I wonder if it is still available ?
To which direction did he run ?
I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ' t seem to be very impressed .
Good morning ! I'd like to buy twelve tickets to Beijing for October 14th .
I hope we shan't have a rough passage .
How did you get on with your studies in university ?
I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious .
You are the leading company in the computer industry .
Sure . I'm going to take more pictures today .
Gas Meter Reader . This is a wonderful job for the right person , regular hours , no night shifts , no supervisor behind you , and good pay .
I don ' t have access to a computer .
I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice .
well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ?
Let's sit over there .
How about the one after that ?
Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ?
We've just started a new business at this bank , Bank-Insurance Link .
Yes , it is nice , but wait until you see the interior .
Oh , I see . When are you leaving ?
I like the kinds of instruments that they use .
Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .
Are you tired after class ?
OK . Let me see .
I like peace . As a matter of fact , I once had a job in a library .
Oh , actually , Tuesday ' s no good . Sorry about that .
That ' s simple . Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions .
You made a perfect choice , Jack .
Um , let me see . Hmm . This antique tea set here is gorgeous .
You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy -- I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ?
Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning . So , let ' s have a try . My treat .
I'm afraid that's too much for us .
Of course . I will find you one .
I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone .
It's been a week , and I haven't slept that well .
Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate !
2 hours and we will meet beside our bus . It's over there .
White .
Do you have an essay you want to send them ?
I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos .
What is this made of ?
First class , sir .
I am not sure , where exactly is it ?
I suppose there's nothing cheaper , is there ?
First , I worked as a servant .
Why not go to the supermarket today , the coupon will be past due in three days .
Attaboy , that's just what I am thinking .
I know what you mean . I can't stand computer geeks .
Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
We have quite a lot of import and export information and can give you figures on population , consumption , production , and foreign exchange reserves .
Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you .
Have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
Did you eat any ice cream ?
Sure . Join my class next week .
How often is the bonus ?
Go to gate 18 . The plane is now boarding . You must hurry .
I haven ' t found one that satisfies my demands yet .
Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat .

There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the newspaper .

So what do you do there ?
Certainly , just fill in this form , please .
Yes . Sit down , please . How did you learn about our company ?
it's getting cold .
No problem . Put your baggage on the scale , please .
Yes , of course . I need your student ID please .
I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first .
And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall .
May , we are fools to hang out at noon . It's dying hot today . My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun .
Frankly yes . We like to employ married people . By the way , do you have any children ?
Evening .
Our pleasure . We have several package tours you may choose , from ten days to three weeks in Europe .
Hi , Kathy . Have you had lunch ?
Please wake me up at 6 am .
I'm sorry that you don't like it .
Will you forgive me ? Could you return my camera ?
No , Dave . I haven't wrecked my jeep . I'm calling to offer you a job .
Ok . Thanks for that information .
Hey ! Look at this ! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach .
Excuse me , Miss .
Ok . Is this your luggage properly labelled , sir ?
Well , with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line .
I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it .
Yes . Will you let me ?
OK . I would like to book a ticket for that one .
I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that .
I ' Ve already paved the way . You just have to give a presentation on what our products are . I will do the follow-up and close the sale .
That's very inconvenient for you then . You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm .
That sounds like a good idea .
Okay , thank you .
I see . Thank you .
We appreciate your help .
We gave you a list of problems last week .
Are you still mad at her now ?
I'll wait .

When is your vacation going to start ?
Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks .
What's your products ' competitive edge ?
( After testing ) Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ?
Let's take a cab .
Is it okay to have a day off next week ?
No , I'm not . you can just drive slowly and carefully .
What do you say to $ 850 a month ?
Definitely . It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul .
And how many computers do you sell each day ?
Your search on this project has been excellent .
Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the lipstick ?
By all means . But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks .
How did you get that burn again ?
Coming up immediately .
Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place calledWild Things ? !
All right . What if we leave your bangs straight and just perm the sides and back ?
Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
There ' s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ?
So it ' s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language .
( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree .
Wow .
Well , it was definitely worth all the time .
What about the features in the room ?
That's right
I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .
Says who ?
I do have the confidence , but I still worry about her .

Good idea . Let's go . Where should we go ?
Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food . Will it be dim sum again ?

Don ' t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ' t love her anymore .
Well , what do you want to eat ?
You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile .
It looks wonderful .
I'll be at your house at about 5:30 . Happy birthday .
I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you .
Four ports .
I get it now .
You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You ' ll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ...
Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ?
Don ' t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ?
The facial will start with thorough cleansing .
I'm OK .
That's all right . How much do they cost ?
She must have done a lot of work on it .
Maybe I'll have to face the music .
What ? I was just having a friendly conversation with the lady here ...
Hi , this is Susan Smith . I ' m calling about my appointment with Doctor Brown today at 3
I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .
You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China .
Here ' s your $ 300 .
Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision .
Fair enough . Keep up the good work .
I work for American Airlines .
Yes , sir . I'll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .

He's with someone right now , would you hold ?
I am doing well . What ' s up with you ?
Hi , Bob , everything okay ?
Do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ?

Tomorrow afternoon .

Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited .
I wanted to talk to you about that , Mr . Eng . Mr . Emory would prefer to keep the deadline as is . We can start earlier if you ' d like .
Hmm . I'll have to think about this for a second .
Toyota Corolla 2002 .
I suggest we visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art first , Now let's go . look people are jogging along the river . Here we are .

Tomorrow afternoon would be fine .
Well , let me see ... Do you work at IBM Corporation ?
Alright . Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you .
Yes , I will . Have a nice flight back .
Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too .
Yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives .
I am going to send you for a CT scan , and I will see you again when we see the results .
Hello , Who's that speaking ?

I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway . Is that her ?
Hello , I ' d like a return to Xi ' an please .
Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things .
Can anyone tell me where I can buy the ingredients to make Chinese food ?
You are !
Turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ?
Yes , Mr . Smith ?
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
What about taking the cable car ?
No . They want children but no luck yet .
Simply because it's not practical at all .
Wow , it has a balcony .
I've fallen in love with my boss .
Look ! I ' v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ?
Hi , Jack . Long time no see !
Yes , certainly , madam .
Ah ... I see .
Yes , it's me . And you're Julie Ashley . How are you ?
Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed .
I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .
Yeah , right here .
David , why don't you clean your room ?
We'll need two bedrooms . The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined .
As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton .
No , thank you , I want to go out on the town . What other ideas do you have ?
This one is much better . Can I try on the ring with this necklace ?
It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
Perhaps I should have a try .
Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in , but against a current .
A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ?
Mr . White , I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company . It will be effective at the beginning of the next month .
What experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ?
It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium .
Yes . I locked myself out . May I borrow a duplicate key for Room 201 ?
What would a typical day be like for me here ?
Yes , sir . Stainless steel products are always popular .
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live alt by himself , I think . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the better .
Yes , there is one at 8: 30 a . m . That arrives at 11:35 a . m .
Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now .
You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi . We can offer you a private vehicle .
Thanks a lot . You are so kind .
Young people ought to carry out their responsibilities . If it's needed , they would live with their parents .
With my dinner , please . And can you take my order for dessert later ?
If I'm in the service center . I'll listen to the client patiently , and accept the criticism objectively . Then I will have the claim reasonably settled .
I'm bleeding too much .
Why didn't you report it before ?
I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same !
You ran the stop sign . May I see your driver's licence , please ?
I really need a new pair of trousers .
I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today !
Well , I have got a vacancy .
Don ' t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him .
Good afternoon . What can I do for you ?
She what ?
Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there .
Until college ?
That's fine .
Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything .
That bad , huh ?
Yes .
Thanks for inviting me , Jack , but I ' Ve already made plans for this weekend . I won ' t be able to come , I ' m afraid .
I don't buy a story .
I'm feeling better today .
Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising .
Yeah , why don't you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week .
I'm catching the eleven o'clock train .
Umm ... that ' s the thumb , Nick .
You seem to be in a hurry .
Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious .
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ' m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while .
My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ?
No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today .
What can we see in it ?
Do I have to pay extra money for it ?
I have some extra help with my project . What would you prefer to help me with , typing or xeroxing ?
We can sleep together .
I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one .
I see . Well , good luck !
Does 6 thirty suit you ?
I hope I can go to your party .
I'm glad to know that everyone made it out okay .

Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ?
I believe so .
That's good . Well , these are for you . I hope you will like them .
The reservation was for a double for three nights , wasn't it ?
I don't think so . It ' s kind of sore .
Excuse me . Where can I buy some cigarettes ?
Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises .
There ' s some , but I don ' t think it ' s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ' s very little major crime .
I like Renaldo the most .
Well , the position is for an account manager . That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team .
Yeah , it happened a week ago .
Hello . This is the front desk . What can I do for you ?
( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb .
You ' re ready , right ?
What do you need help with ?
Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ?
Same here .
Yes , but not too stiff , right ?
Ok . The manicurist will be right here .
sure . I ' d be happy to give you some hints and advice .
That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark .
I don ' t think so .
When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ?
On second thought , I think I'll join you .
do you want noodles , vegetables , rice , meat , seafood , beans , or dessert ?
yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ?
What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .
Hi , you said that you might need some help with preparing dinner . What would you like me to do ?
I think it's OK . I also have two credit cards .
What is that ? What are you doing ? You ' re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ?
I want to inform you of the interview .
Well , when you do your darks , can you wash some of mine too ?
I want an American breakfast with fried eggs , sunny side up .
Do you know the day they plan to open ?
I come to try my new suit . Here's the receipt .
But this should have been handed in last Thursday .
I know . I think it may rain .
How's Mrs Zu doing these days ?
Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time .
No , I think that I've had enough of this restaurant .
Could you drop me off at the airport ?
Song , I hate to say goodbye , but I have to .
How about your academic records at college ?
Can I see the receipt ?
Are you engaged ?
I want to go to the financial stree .
Can you name some courses you completed ?
Is it very interesting ?
My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German .
Here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % .
My name is Woody .
Oh , the company is the fourth largest machine producer in the world . It was founded in the United States in 1980 . I know that the company has made good use of advanced technology .
Have you heard about John ' s obscene words towards the manager ?
She's getting coupons from her desk .
Yes , so this year we are going to take our first family vacation , just you and I .
Would you give me a bottle of beer , please ?
You'll see this charge on your amenities account .
Well , I heard David has been fired .
Must be one smart guy .
Who was elected ?
Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ?
Should I clean the windshield for you ?
Are you having a good time ?
Ok . Here you are . Is that all right now ?
Yes , quite often .
What are you going to play ?
I'm sorry , Mr . Sandals , but we accept only MasterCard or VISA .
Not some crazy diet fat I hope .
Did you call us ?
Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ?
Yes , apparently four stores were broken into .
Yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of World War I and World War II .
Sounds painful !
Have you ever seen a hurricane ?
Welcome to the International Business Department . How can I help you ?
Take care , and give my best to your parents .
That ' s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ?
I wish I could , but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .
Good luck . I hope someone can help you .
You are excellent .
Terrible . How about people's lives ?
Yes . I'd like your breakfast special , please .
I guess it is . The restaurant is on the second floor . Please enjoy your dinner , sir !
I'm sorry I can't , because I haven't finished my thesis .
Do you reimburse for education that relates to my job ?
Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air .
Hmm ... How long will it take to mail things to the USA by air ?
Sorry . There aren't any tickets available for the 19:00 train .
Well , I ' d like to , but I ' m going to have to look at my schedule .

Why don't you try to give it up ?
He's such a mother hen .
My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo .
She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ?
Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ?
As long as I don ' t have to row .
Dad , can you help me ?
A little bit .
Okay , sir , but remember how close it is to your checkout time .
I'm worried that she can't catch up with her class .
Well , I ' Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office .
I ' m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ?
It's 2065 meters . Come on . Let us keep up the pace .
Very good . Here is your room key , sir . If you need anything at all , please dial 0 .
But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ?
That sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . If they think you don ' t know better , they ' ll try to get more .
No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things .
I already have .

Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us .
Less than one hour .

Keep your back straight and look forward . Good . Do about 3 sets of 20 .
Yes , we do . we also eat mutton .
Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to ?

How many children do Cindy and Ron have ?
Of course not !
Do you have life insurance ?
When do you start school ?
You can tell me here . I just want to know the price .
Yes I am . And you ...
Yes , my brakes are not working well .

I really didn't mean to .
Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts
I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday .
Yes , there is a lake in the park . It is very beautiful .
Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ?
oh , that's too short-lived .
That explains it .
No problem . Do you want 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 ?
But it ' s unfair .
I don't know yet .
I slipped and fell downstairs .
Yes , can I help you ?
Yet in writing , George has nothing on Frank .
It was really an exciting moment .
It's frustrating !
Why don ' t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you .

It's Marcia Gleason .
By the way , it was really thoughtful if you to get me the ticket . I really appreciate it , I'll buy some popcorn , and drinks for us .
Ok . Please go ahead .
My husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids .
Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it .
Some next week on , we should be in less of a rush .
Yeah , I ' m dealing with it . Anyway . Thank you , Mike .
I bought it at half price .
I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ?
So you will continue to study for a master's degree ?

Hi Mark .
SW113 leaves at 13:25 . Would you want one ?
It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday , which is tomorrow .
It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network .
Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot .
I ' m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift .
No . I ' d better not .
Alternatively , we do offer wireless in our lobby . You can bring your laptop down here .
Um . That doesn ' t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German .
Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .
If you really want to learn , remind me when you get back from your business trip .
You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here .
Definitely beer . Two bottles .
You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know .
Hi , What's for lunch ?
On 20th May 1963 .
Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !
There's a major problem with room 507 .

Of course . We ' Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ' s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone .
I know ! I never had the guts to tell you ... until today . So , what do you say ? Are you willing to give me a shot ?
That sounds really tasty .
I ' m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ?
Hmm . Sounds like she has pretty pricey tastes .

To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby .
Ok , I will call you if you give me your name card .
No , sir . Where to ?
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident -- cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs -- you can ' t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil .
Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ?
500 pieces .
Oh ? Why is that day ?
Maybe you can pick Mary ' s brains now . She knows a lot about stocks .

I wish I could tell you yes , but no , there isn't .

A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable .

Thanks , Miss . I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in .
will you get a pay-raise , too ?
Good . I will have hot chocolate .
Do I have to wear ear muffs and gloves ? I am not used to working with them on .
What kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ?
Then what do I do with the cup ?
I know that , it's The English Patient . It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s .
Thank you for letting me add your class .
What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .
It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it .
Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ?
Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience .
Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .
Would you like to make a donation ?
You mean ... like on a second date ?
He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune .
I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
I received a bachelor's degree .
Thank you . May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows ?
No , you have to pay it by yourself .
Well , then , how much do I owe you ?
But , but ... it was really an emergency ! And , my stub ...
What test do you do for high blood pressure ?
If you were assigned some work which you are not so interested , would you take it or not ?
But it's the style now .
That's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
Hi , still in the office ? It ' s already 7 .
Come on ! You can go tomorrow , just skip it today . It's not as if you are gonna get in trouble !
I like the design of the coat .
Yes . That ' s why we have everything on computer files . We don ' t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client .
From April 16th to 20th . Just my wife and myself .
It is tough to accept it , I mean . But can you tell me why ?
Hi , Bill , this is my new car .
You know on a date , they are going to dinner .
Fine , honey . Rome couldn't be built with in one day .
Gross !
I want to change my job .
Julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing .
Susan ? We ' re having a farewell party for John Anderson today .
thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ?
Well , Let's get down to business ( shall we ? ) Now is probably a good time to start our discussion , the main purpose of this meeting is to talk about the benefits and disadvantages of our new project .
Oh , it's such a pain . We'd better go to a store later .
you could try . It would save you a lot of money .
So I know . Thanks .
I'll pay by charge card then .
Well , don't do this again next time . What is it about , anyway ?
I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow .
It ' s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ' s some traffic , but not much . It ' s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ' ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ?
I'm not sure . Medium , I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side .
How long has your tooth been bothering you ?
American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ' t many chances .
That's OK . I can get it from you later .
Do you like watching football matches ?
What sports do you like to play ?
Sure . In the middle part of the fifth street , there is a Phoenix Restaurant . Maybe you can go there .
Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much .
Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today . I've found out that time and money get away very easily -- you think you have them , and they're gone ! Putting things off just makes it worse later , so even if it's hard at the time , I try to get things done that day and not let them go .
Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim .
Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you .
A ham salad sandwich .
Good evening , I'm so happy you could come .
No , I don't think she's that strong-minded .
Thank you . I appreciate your help .
Sure it was .
I think 2,000 would be fine .
Thank you very much for your cooperation .
May I show you the gold ones ?
Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ' t know man .
I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street . Can I take any bus that comes along ?
I could help pay for it .
Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines .
That ' s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later .
Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson .
How much does a student pass cost ?
You'll be covered by our medical plan while on duty . Since you'll be middle management , you're expected to be available up to 1 . 5 hours past normal working hours . Any approved time over that will be paid at time and a half , which you can take as salary or time off .
Of course , here you are , sir .
Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ?
John Smith .
The park is so beautiful . It is a good thing I have taken the camera .
Bingo could never do that . He stays in the house except when we take him to the park .
Let me get the student bus pass .
You can buy them either ripe or unripe . Unripe ones are hard .
the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car -- even in the summer !
Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples !
You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
Then your salary must be high .
Are you having any luck with the worms ?
See ? It ' s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .
Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you .
We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained .
I'm looking for a leather belt for my husband .
Here . Look at this shirt . Try it on .
So , did I tell you about my New Year ' s resolution ? I ' Ve decided to go on a diet .
You can bring life photos , recommendation letters and certificates .
Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ' s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ?
I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know .
Good morning . I'd like to reserve some rooms for a tourist party .
Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ?
The internet doesn't come up at all ?
My name is Steven . May I ask whether I can have an interview ?
No , listen to me . I always regard you as my best friend . I admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . I should thank you .
Would you make gay marriage legal ?
There is no pepper here .
No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically .
Days ?
you mean the boy you met on MSN ?
Who's that ?
That ' s a good idea . You ' Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand .
I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . We ' ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce .
And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal .
Good . You will feel better after you do .
Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue .
Well . The management doesn't seem to think that way . Anyways , you have to think twice before you act .
Who's this Eric guy ?
Wonderful , I'll go with you .
How about we go and get something to drink ?
May I help you , sir ?
Tian'anmen Square .
Are all of my test results on that site ?
Then , do you have " tea time " every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ?
I wonder which looks more lustrous .
anytime before 6 pm tonight .
Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker .
To be honest , I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it .
Admittedly , I don't . But I still beg you to give me an opportunity , and I'm willing to learn with my best effort .
You look a bit pale , don't you ?
it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !
I ' m going as fast as I can !
Let me see . Your plane leaves from Gate 12 . You should go to Gate 12 to board your plane
Do you want to transfer money from that account ?
Good morning , sir . I am ready to check out now .
We plan to get together once a week .
Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?
Does it have a lock ?
and check whether they accept credit cards .
I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you .
Okay , try this one . It's made of aluminum .
What are the good sights to see in Beijing ?
Yes , you may enjoy a seven-day holiday in the first year . After that , you can have two more days each year .
You're right , no problems . You are becoming quite the expert , Mr Lawson . If any problem does turn up , which I'm sure it won't , I'll give you a call .
OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract .
I've just been working really hard .
It gives you money ?
Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too .
Morning , Mike .
What's your counter-offer then ?
I guess we'll see just around .
I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is .
that's a good idea .
What ? What did you buy ?
What are you doing , Janice ?
I like NBA very much .
Dude , don ' t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ' t you ?
What do you want to eat for breakfast ?
OK . Let me try it .
I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day . But how about my paper ?
Did you have a fight with Jack ?
Four in hundred , one in ten , please .
Where's the peeler ?
They have really good chow mein .
But where do I get a ticket ?
It's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop .
I ' m looking for a job . Are you hiring ?
Uh-huh .
From July the seventh to the ninth .
How many in your party ?
Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ?
Excuse me . Does this train go to Brooklyn ?
Good . I'll take it right now , if possible .
Sure , but I don ' t have hot water , yet .
Indeed . He's strict with himself too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared .
Would you like to come to our factory for a visit ?
OK . Have you signed the consent ?
Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers .
You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves .
The ship is going very fast .
I'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook .
Sir , I need to go back to get my jewelry box .
What kind of account do you want to open ?
Yes , I would , as long as it's good quality .
I know you have a tight schedule , so I won't take up more of your time . Have a good evening .
You also need to choose a gift for your father , right ?
Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ?
Do you mind if I smoke here ?
Hi , Mark ! Hi , do you have a minute ?
Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up !
I need help figuring out how to use this phone .
I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ' Good morning , Jim . '
It's all good . I'll show you all the right moves . My name's Malik .
I think I know , because this happened before .
Then we'll put you in a cast .
Good idea . My wife has a fine ear for music . I am sure she would like it .
isn't there anything else ?
The aircraft is equipped with onboard phones . They do not interfere with the communication and navigation of the aircraft .
Bob , how about joining the boxing club this summer vacation ?
Then ...
Yeah man , I ' m starving !
I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice .
as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ?
I was worried about canceling the climbing .
I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information .
Yes . Second , as you can imagine , attitude and friendliness go a long way .
Send an ambulance fast ! My husband is having a heart attack !
Some places aren't good to go . But I can show you the right bus to take . It will be no problem .
Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty . Can you cook them ?
Will you fill out this form , please ?
First , can I know something about your financial situations ?
My grades weren ' t good enough to go here .
Hello . What can we do for you ?
No problem . I have you appointment changed from tomorrow morning to tomorrow afternoon at one fifteen .
How nice these sunglasses are !
Science ? That's a surprise .
I'm sorry , but I don't know that name . You must have the wrong number .
I heard Nick found a job in a bank and his salary is said very high . I also want to work there .
Here are your keys . I ' ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ' m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ' ll always love you . Goodbye .
That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester .
Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ?
Wait a moment , please .
I ' m sorry , Jim .
Great ! Wait here ? You don ' t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ?
Which gate ?
How long do you plan to stay here ?
It ' s plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won ' t take your twenty minutes to get there .
I'm afraid this flight is all booked up .
The usual , you know , something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent .
Could you tell me the particulars ?
Yes , I played with Tony and John .
Why don't you join us to go out for a walk ?
Oh , here you are .
Do you know what class you want to take ?
Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things .
Do you believe in god ?
There are three , my parents and I .
He ' s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ?
no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?
Yes I do , usually .
I'll be please to if I can . What can I do for you ?
You need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the flyer .
Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month .
Thank you for understanding . I promise I'll make it up to you .
I was born in Beijing in 1965 .
Alright and what is your name , please ?
Some do , some don't . Many people in the North are fond of liquors . I think it has something to do with the climate .
Well , the books are in the box . What can I do now ?
Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches .
Bill Smith .
How much is a postcard ?
Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think .
Would you like to order anything off the appetizer menu ?
Yes . Shall I get one for you ? Just push the button over there if you need anything .
A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us !
Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty .
Good . That will help me know how I am doing .
He's after your own heart , it is important .
That wasn ' t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . I'm about to explode !
What kind of food do you want to get ?
OK .
It's for a job . It looks perfect for you .
Oh , really ? Were you not caught ?
Hello . I want to reconfirm our flight to London .
Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ?
Is this your brother-in-law ?
25 . 00 dollars a week , but you can't have visitors .
My title was Project Manager . There were almost 100 people under my supervision .
Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project .
Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant .
OK . But you have to promise me that you will study hard in your English class .
it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model .
What classes does she take ?
I'll finish soon .
I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know .
Ouch !
I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor .
So you speak German , don't you ?
Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ?
Never mind .
So , want me to book the tickets again ?
It ' s the anniversary of our weeding .
Are you OK ?
Should I do anything else ?
Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime .
Is that US dollars ?
Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ?
Very nice . I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time .
that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ?
All of it is important ; please just do your best at all times .
Obviously , it depends on what I'm cooking , but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
Ideally , I ' d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ' m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting .
I read or go swimming , go shopping , usually . I run or play tennis or do something else like those to get some exercises to keep fit .
Why did you buy that painting ?
Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary .
Good morning . I ' m looking for a new jacket .
Yes . How much do you want ?
That's why many people died in the earthquake .
Oh , please do not mention it any more . Last night he did it for the first time .
OK , sir . Your suit will be available in five days .
You are in the pink recently . How do you make it ?
Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ?
No , I can ' t speak French . But I can speak Italian , not very well though .
Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ' s the matter .
Where should I sit ?
Oh , I ' m crazy about them .
Yes , it is . It's brilliant .
Don't worry , time is enough .
I'm pretty good .
yes , they were horrible . We had to wear green every day !
I am clear about your sweet tooth , so I made a mixed fruit dish for you .
Well , it's probably nothing serious . But I think we'd better have that shoulder X-rayed . We can't do the until the morning , though . So it'd be better if you stay in hospital for the night
Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day .
Well , you might be the person we ' Ve been looking for . Do you have any questions ?
I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him .
May I interrupt you for a moment ?
OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ?
I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there .
I hear that you are in love with Mike .
I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment .
I have been attending an evening course in English writing for 2 years and I often read novels , magazines and newspapers in English .
I want to go to china for sight-seeing . What do you think of it , Mum ?
Excuse me . Have you forgotten our drinks ?
Show us our itineraries , please .
I will go trade those pancakes for waffles right now .
No . I would rather just return it .
Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can do for you ?
That's tough . What does your wife think about this ?
Have a nice flight back , and take care . Thanks for your call .
All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ?
Sure . Wait a moment .
Can I ?
I don't think the meet will go on much longer , should I ask him to call you when he is free .
Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ?
Very badly , doctor .
Is dinner served ?
Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www . StudioClassroom . com . tw for the recipe .
You will raise your arms up shoulder high .
I ' m so happy that he did .
I need to cancel that . We have had a last minute change of plans .
In that case , please put my name in your waiting list . We know you are quite a good restaurant .
Oh , that's not everything . You're free on Friday and then on Saturday you're catching the 9 o'clock plane back to Guangzhou .
Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ?
What ' s wrong ? Didn ' t you think it was fun ? !
Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?
Well , I have a lot of experience in this area . I have all the qualifications you need . I enjoy working with people . In my current job , I ' m in charge of a team of eight people .
Oh , dear !
Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ?
No problem . Go ahead , please .
Yes , sir . What can I do for you ?
Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there .
Well , I strongly suggest you going to London . It's really charming .
Thank you , they are beautiful .
What time are you leaving ?
Why should he do that ? It isn't illegal for us to go in .
All right . Thanks a lot .
You ' re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ' t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ?
Yes . I hope it will remain fine all the way .
Actually , Costa Rica isn't in South America . It's in Central America .
I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag . Where can we buy one ?
What would you prefer ? Red wine or white ?
( A few minutes later . ) Should I get off at the next stop ?
How was it ?
We supply washers of all types and sizes . We have years of experience in the manufacture of washers .
Oh , I see .
Yes . What about you ?
It would be good for both if they lived separately . My parents want to live apart from us .
I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?
I plan to emigrate to Canada .
Where are you from , Sam ?
Yes , I'd like to buy a new computer , but I don't really know much about them . Can you give me any suggestions ?
No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D .
This is amazing . I'm glad we decided to take this bus tour . So where next ?
What about the surrounding area ?
No problem . Say ' cheese ' . That's good . Please wait a moment .
That's wonderful .
Is it a through one ?
Yes , I am going to meet a client .
Where is Tom ? It was his idea to have the bachelor party at a ETV , wasn't it ?
They arrested me for nothing .
If you're a registered guest , you have free access to our swim stations .
I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .
Sure , anytime .
Really ? Let ' s hit the road .
Can I help you find something ?
Well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ?
Here you go . Is that it ?
Will this be cash or charge ?
I'm going to be on time today .
Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ?
Oh , did they ? Well , would you give us an extra key to the room ?
Then you must go to the airport .
No , they got engaged .
I see . How much exactly ?
Well , they don ' t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself .
Oh , that's too bad . Should I call a doctor ?
I can ' t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ?
So the time for the total journey is about ... ?
I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league .
Ok . Which facial would you like ? We have five different kinds of facials .
Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this .
I was turned down again . It ' s frustrating . I guess you ' Ve got to teach me some skills .
No problem . Let me have one .
Please fill out this form , and what's in your package ?
Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk .
Let ' s go check out the bedroom and bathroom .
Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment .
Yes . I am calling to make sure if flight CG877 will arrive on time ?
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ' s something wrong with the fax machine .
He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad .
Job fairs are popular places to look for work .
No , I haven ' t been back for more than ten years .
I need some documentation from you . Such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and I already have your credit details here .
I am not feeling very well . I've got a bad cold .
But I don't think so . No one has ever said a word that you are to die , only yourself . That means you are not willing to die , right ? Actually , you are recovering and what you imagine as your worry is slowing down the treatment . Many cases worse than yours turned out to be hopeful and successful . You must be confident . Your condition is much better physically , but a little bi difficult mentally . The most important thing for you now is cooperation with us .
That ' s great . What are the prizes ?
I would like to open a Current Account , please .
What should we buy ?
And then later everyone eats the food ?
Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment .
It's so nice of you . You really make my day .
My feet is size 37 .
I'm planning to return to China after graduation .
So , how are you feeling today ?
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
I believe I am a six .
I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff . Is that true ?
Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ' t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first .
What time does the train for Boston leave ?
Next please .
Excuse me , can you recommend some places for us to go tonight ?
I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat !
I want to grow in my job and move ahead .
Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired .
Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice .
I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it ?
My mother bought me a new video game .
May I order , please ?
Of course . He is now 50 years old . And he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films . He has also become an independent producer and director .
Sorry , Mr . Wood is not here right now . Do you have any message for him ?
Should I date Tom or should I date Harry ?
Okay by me .
Would you like to stretch your legs ?
Cool ! That's a great idea . What did you have in mind ?
Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training .
Lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age , but young people want an unconstrained life .
What do you think about our company ?
We can take care of that for you , too . You can get all of your usual banking services plus some new extra ones . As this service is net bases , you can do it anywhere .
Click your right key of mouse and choose QQ Zone .
Yes . They ' re coming the beginning of August .
Black .
Yes , but I ' m afraid it ' s still a mess . I haven ' t put anything away yet .
Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere .

Most of the time that is what I prefer .
Someone has stolen my cell phone .
Wow ! Where's the treasure ?
Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act .

I'll take one , too .
That'd be great ! Thank you .
No , I'm still full from dinner .
Do you receive traveler's checks ?
Pls fill it up with water then .

Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London .
I'm afraid yes . But what about the data I stored in the computer ?
Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too .

Yes , I'm checking out .
Do you think it looks good on me ?
I suppose I do .
Well . I ' ll see , sometimes the store don't have some one of new kinds of cereal .
I think the price is a little high , can't you reduce it
And what did the program say ?
Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal .
Well , how about Gramercy Tavern ? It's a very popular tourist spot , with great food and music .
Mr . : I'm asking the class to read page 10 to themselves . Then I'm going to ask some questions about the passage .

How much will I have to pay ?
I do sympathize with you , I assure you .
No , enough .
I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .
Caesar salads are good .

I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .
I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ?

Glad to meet you . Mr Stewart . I'm the guide from Pacific Tour Agency . My name is Zhang Hua .
Excuse me . Could you tell me the way to the Star Hotel ?
No , I didn't feel like it .
That's all right . This sort of thing happens all the time to everyone .
OK , you mean the vacant one on the left ?
There must be something wrong with her .
Fine , just don't do it at night .
When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level .
Are you even glad that we get to buy new clothes too ?
And what's your vision ?
Hey , what's wrong with the TV ?
She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see .
Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now .

Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together .
it was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ' t take a lot of money or time .
No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ?
No , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .
No , I'm stuffed . I'm ready for the check .
Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ?
Not funny .
Even though I was late turning in my form , will my paycheck be late ?
So this is a real thing ?
Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I took up dancing quite recently .
Actually , I have applied to several companies recently . But I am most satisfied with your company .
Well , every stamp has a story to tell .
Thank you . Here is a copy of the Tour Guide Certificate of mine .

I see why you didn't stop .
Tragedy .
No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly .
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet , I have no idea how I could have picked a virus .
That ' s even better than the real thing .
I like collecting stamps .
Let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back .

It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen .

Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are . Take this and pay to the woman over there .
But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it .

where are you planning on going ?
Do you mind being next to the elevator ?
No , maybe they're not . But they're close .
Or discuss what gifts they could buy together .

Do you have a valid license ?
Yes , please ask when you want to borrow my records next time .
Who finances the magazine ?
Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ?
What do you think of the leading actors ?

Would you please give to me , and will imprint it ?
Well , you ' d better heat it before you eat it .
Please fill out this form , and then take your parcel to the counter on my left-hand side .

Sorry . What shall we get for her ?
A lot of things aren't fair . That's life .
Are you usually busy ?
When are you leaving ?
Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences .
I am looking for a sweater .
What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ?
The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice .
Their range of organic foods is very limited .
We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price .
To be honest , I don't really like doing either one , I can't cook and I hate cleaning .
Will you do the dishes after the meal ?
Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ?
At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day .
Very well . Just take your time .
I have to go to court ?
Me too . I need something to read on the flight to new york . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ' s books for her daughter .
I usually only have 2 beers .
Just some soft drinks and only a bottle of beer .
You can choose classes that you like at the school office .
Maybe some other time .

Excuse me .
Thank you , sir .

When will he come back , do you know ?
Just take a little off on the top and shorten the back . But please don't make it too short .
Uh-oh . It'll probably cost a lot to fix it .
It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ?
hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor .
You must show where and when you tried to look for work . If you earned any money , you need to tell them about it .
is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ' t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one .
What do you do in your spare time ?
Is my VCR ready ?
Oh , that's convenient , but ... how much crime is there ?
It sure looks special , looks expensive too .
I really have to get to Paris by this evening . Would you please try to find any other available flight ?
ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .

In your first letter , that is , when you apply for admission , you should also tell them you need their financial aid .
You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ?

It's January .
Can you start on Monday ?
Hello , Pineapple Computer Company . This is Janice Shaw , the secretary of Nova . May I ask who is calling ?
See you around .
Why can I learn it ?
I could give you a few pointers if you want . I know a lot about coffee .
Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere .
My tooth is killing me !
At your service . Will this suit you ?
Great . Shall I meet you there around 7 forty-five tomorrow night ?
You forgot ? You ...
well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .
Look , the printer isn ' t functioning well . I ' Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ' s going on ?
I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ?
Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature .
Really ? What did you think ?
Well , what kind of dessert do you want ?
Haggis ? What ' s Haggis ?
I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ?

Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged .
Can you recognize Mike's father in the crowd ?

So it seems . And what are you going to do about that ?
We are sure to responsible to replace the defective ones .
really ? What do you usually do online ?
Were you ? your performance was excellent .
Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ?
I ' ll do that for you .
Tomorrow is my wife's birthday .
The only two times you need are I'm late and I'm really late .
Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately ?
Tell me something about yourself and your past experience .
I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ' Ve got ourselves a situation here .
Many happy returns of the day , darling ?

No kidding ! We'll miss the connecting flight .
We still prefer French dressing .
May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ?
Is there anything else ?
No , we are just too different . This isn ' t working .
What style do you want ?
No , but she does wear contact lenses .
That ' s a hefty amount . But that should have no problem at all . You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge , though .
You asked for it .
The price on the tag says £ 565 but maybe you can get a discount .
Yesterday I saw your company's advertisement . Your company is an important international company . Working for it , I believe it can improve my abilities .
You didn ' t show up in the morning meeting . What ' s up ?
Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .
Oh , I see , by the way , my name's Mary .
Maybe . I haven ' t been able to keep my food down either . That ' s unusual .
Really ? Can ' t you stay a little longer ?
Thanks . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it .
But are the public schools good everywhere ?
Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off .
I'll stay at home and have a complete rest .
About freezing point , I think . But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero .
Yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . You see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . What's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . As a teacher , you should be a little more sedate .
Jane . Nice to meet you .
Yes . Do you have a pharmacy here , please ?
What is the customer's name , and what is his room number ?
Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ' s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others .
20 yuan for a skirt .
Now what can I do for you ?
I've never met anyone like Clyde before .
Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later .
Thank you for inquiring . But your enquiry is too vague to reply .
How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ?
You know , that ' s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise .
Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .
R :: From April 16th to 20th . And which kind of room would you prefer , sir ?
No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge .
Take this web page for example . Press the keys " control " and " d " together . Click on " favourites " at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again .
I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want .
Oh , I don't know . It depends .
What are you studying ?
I would like to place an order .
we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system .
Yes . There are many places where the gorge is very narrow , with steep cliffs on both sides .
I ' ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
Could you just run through the evacuation procedure ?
Why not ? The Sweetheart pendant matches the cell phone well . I'd take this one .
you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ' s seat !
Let me clear away the broken glass .
Let me count . Ok , it works out for my schedule . Thanks a lot !
I don't understand why I'm being arrested .
Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist .
You forgot it last year as well .

I do all the cooking .
Why do you choose our company ?
Yes . The porter will go and help you .
Would you like some soup first ?
You mean finally Henry bought the broken car himself .
Let me see . How much should I pay for you ?
Sorry , but he's busy then too .
I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss .
That's the sign of wind .
Fine , but next time try and not have to miss class again .
Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ' t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ' m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so .
Coach .
Well , three days .
How long is the boat time-table effective ?
No , you can't , darling . The grass is wet .
So then , why don't you just go ?
Why do you buy stocks , then ?
How long would you like us to keep it ?
Mom , what can I do for you today ?
Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement .
Alright , Ma'am . What items would you like to order today ?
Sure . What kind of toast do you like ?
I ' d like to go to the railway station please .
Are you familiar with the office management ?
You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets .
I think I have nothing to declare . I have just brought a bottle of wine .
Really ?
That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order .
About a year ago actually . You've probably never seen her though .
You can say that again . Susan ' brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ' s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit .
I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
Good evening . Could you let us have a double room ?
Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday .
I hate cigarettes ! Nonsmoking .
Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting .
How about forty-five ?
I ' m sorry , Janet . I left it at home . I ' ll bring it back in the morning .
Arthur , that ' s the bathroom .
Where do I get the application form for unemployment benefits ?
What kind of work are you interested in ?
It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues .
Ok . You need to know what they like or dislike , what religions they follow . Especially you need to know how they behave , their habits and their way of life , the things that they are used to . Sometimes , people in different countries , have varying outlooks for cultural , political , religious .
I know . There are too many cars on the roads these days .
You have a perfect taste !
What race is he ?
I want to get in touch with the Chinese Embassy because my passport was in the stolen bag .
Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun .

Right now , I ' ll take about anything that will pay the mortgage .
Yes , I ' m looking for a pair of trousers .
Let's go .
By the middle of October . This is the best we can do .
I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time .
Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house .
When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ?
My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip .
It ' s double A , R , O , N .
Do you have any questions you want to ask ?
No foot gives out scent .
How embarrassing !
On what days are the classes ?
Is there a big selection of organic foods at Whole Foods ?
See you later ! Drive carefully .
But what will you do if you need to know the price of something ?
Excuse me . My name is David Walker . Haven't we met before ?

Thank you . Have a nice trip .
Really ? What was the matter ?
As a journalist , I have strong communication skills . I am good at both discourse management and strategic competence .
Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me .

Do you think people still have faith in the government ?

Very good sir . Here is your bill . Please check and sign it .
I'm glad you enjoyed the city , anyway . But please don't think too unkindly of us .
No , I think it's enough .
I'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like Halle .
I am going to contact the sellers immediately . They were looking forward to your acceptance .
I have to move .
What ' s the life expectancy in your country ?
Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom .
Can I have this shoe in the black please ?
If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ?

Do I have to pay an installation fee ?
Good morning , Mr . Green . Please have a seat . I received your resume last Monday and I would like to say I ' m very impressed .
What ' s up ? You look so blue .
Maybe it was Dick .
It seems to me that you always do better than you say .
We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! !
I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ?
From 9A . M . to 5 P . M .
Please call us if you change your mind .
I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye .
Yes , I couldn't agree with you more . A 1 year time deposit it is !
That happens often these days . Well , please fill in this Report of Theft .
Apartments in the city are expensive .
No , we don ' t really care because they are all pretty good around here .
All right . Thank you .
I liked it . I thought it was great .
I think so . I feel very hot .
Sounds fun . Anyone I know ?
I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want .
Thanks doc , bye !
Is there some reason why you can ' t get enough sleep ?
Is there a doctor here ?
Yes , that's very important .
How much are you withdrawing today ?
No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop .
Why don't we get you some shirts ?
To begin with , I have to use chopsticks .
You know the sales figure shows that the prediction has not achieved .
Yes . You always have a good nose for wines .
What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably .
I am unsure how to add a class and need help .
Hold on
You ' re so picky sometimes .
Would you and your wife care to come to our place and have tea with us some afternoon ?
Lures ? We're using live bait over here .
I am so sorry , madam !
Do you believe in UFO's ?
I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses .
Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit ? It's a clever design .
Well , I confess . I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that .
Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry .
it's ok . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I wouldn't know what shade to buy .
It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone .
oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine .
OK . Give me your address .
He ' s really good looking . he ' s quite tall , around 61 , he ' s in his early thirties , and he ' s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ...
Today is Saturday , isn't it ?
You can't beat me at tennis .
Here ' s 50 dollars . Keep the change .
It looks like it was made just for you .
Hello , Fairbrook Consulting , how may I help you ?
But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil .
Never mind that . Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki . If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles .
No , I borrowed it .
Did you like your work ?
I see . Well , what do you recommend then ?
That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ?
We like a larger wardrobe .
May I ask you why you left the job ?
Of course , she should take minutes .
Rose , is this you ?
Hey man ! How ' s it hanging ?
I have a meeting with my General Manager .
What're you going to wear today ?
Sure . This is Claire .
Thank you . I was operated on for gastric ulcer .
Yes , just like Christmas in western countries , it is a time for eating lots of special food .
Things are going fairly well . How about you ?
Excuse me . Where is the Beijing railway station ?
Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ?
No , I haven't seen those spots .
Well , before , I was the skinniest guy on the beach .
May I help you find something , or are you just looking ?
I've received a full scholarship , so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying .
Yes , I will have a cup of coffee .
In what ways ?
I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend .
Yes , I need this prescription please .
No , usually they're very busy .
of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .
Yes , sir . May I help you ?
For sure ! I didn ' t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US .
It costs only two thousand yuan .
Great . I ' m looking forward to it .
What would your colleagues say about you ?
This one will suit me best . What do you think ?
I prefer not to move first .
How will you ship the order ?
Okay , I will .
You'll find the cereal by the breakfast foods .
why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare .
Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said . There ' s a lot of noise outside .
The leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?
Only 15 NT per section . Oh look , that is your bus .
We are on the high way . I'm the * * .
75,000 per year .
My domicile is Beijing .
It's a lot better than soda .
Yes , we must . What have you been doing since I last saw you ?
Just a couple things , here's a list .
The job has a menu plan where you are given a fixed amount of money and you choose what you most need in terms of benefits .
It seldom rains this summer .
That's right . I think we all have much we can learn from each other .
thanks for those ideas . I ' ll get to work on them right away .
Let me know if I can do anything for you .
You mean you like to study English ? Why ?
How are you ? I haven't heard from you in ages .
He's very handsome , I think .
Our maths teacher is rather humorous .
Yes , it's nice and bright .
Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office !
Looks like you ' re going to lose out on this game then .
Do you like swimming ?
I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at !
Thanks . Now I ' d like to check out this book .
Did anyone get hurt ?
I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB .
Are you certain that that is what you want to do ?
I need to withdraw some money .
Six and a quarter , I believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure .
Oh , that ' s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel .
How about some coffee or tea then ?
You're right . I'll take them all .
Hello , is that 2896919 16 ?
Excuse me , could you do me a favor ?
that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies .
Will the numbers mean anything to me ?
I don't think so . Michael .
Who won ?
no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs .
These are from Mexico .
Oh dear , I ' m late . I have to be in the office by 8am .
Yes . you can The fitting room is right over there .
Hello , can I speak to Mark Wyatt , please ?
Yes , I do . They are about two miles away , right ?
What's so bad about it ?
On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty .
Your father looks much younger in the picture .
Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ?
Whew ! Thanks , Karen . That car almost hit me .
Thank you . I don't think there should be any problems , but just to be sure ...
Thank you for visiting our products . I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ?
It doesn't matter . Just do your best to sell yourself .
That ' s Charles .
What a hot day !
Yes . Here you are .
Okay , I guess that's it . Let's go pay for this stuff .
OK . I never forget it .
How kind of you ! Good-bye .
I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .
Now that it is all over . can I go now ?
Maybe .
If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .
No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ' church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ' ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ' s going to be a professional opera singer ?
How much did you bid ?
I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks .
Yes , just a moment , please .
Is it a long run to the station ?
I feel exactly the same way as you .
Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients .
No , I need directions , please .
Let ' s cross here .
Sorry , I don ' t know . I ' m a passengers ' m waiting for my train ..
I've been thinking about this for a while now .
I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways .
Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department .
It's excellent .
It ' s all so interesting . I ' ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class .
Mark , you really did a good job .
I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ?
of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ?
Any other requirements ?
Oh , yes . Thank you . I'd be glad to .
My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often .
I hope to hear from you very soon .
You can either list your job experience next or your education--whichever is the most impressive should be first .
Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .
Do you see anything that you like ?
Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
I'm glad that some of you get it , but let's go over it once more .
How did you know ?
Hello , Ms Li , this is Mr Peng .
I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ?
What are you doing to your house ?
Yes , ma'am . Here we are .
Altogether you have to pay $ 800 .
Certainly , perhaps .
Yes . And come here for tourism .
No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ?
I saw it in this ad for apartments in today ' s newspaper .
How could I feel easy ? I ' m really pissed .
I ' m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ' re always so negative .
What do you mean by us ?
So no more regret now ?
It's Valentine's Day . Come on . Just go .
Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations .
That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ?
You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ?
No , I have no girlfriend .
Are we going all out or just starting with a mini family vacation ?
Does it rain a lot in summer there ?
Well , it gives me money , but it's my own money .
Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ' s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt !
Do you enjoy your work ?
Well , you should have thought .
I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . Let's go .
You bet . I ' ll swing by after lunch , okay ?
Excuse me , would you mind taking a picture for us ?
Hi , I want to check out .
Hello , this is 5735647 5 .
Alright , sir .
Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation .
I absolutely love what you're wearing today .
Excuse me , waiter . Could we change our table for that one ? My wife is quite interested in the scenery .
It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ?
The requirements are strong communicational skills , management and work assiduously . And you have to handle the recurring crisis good-humoredly and discreetly .
Does the material stand washing ?
Yes , I ' m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four .
Do you have a benefits brochure ?
What a bother having to climb storeys home every day .
Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ?
Just go ! It's Valentine's Day !
Premium , PLS . Could you check my tyres , too ? I think they need air .
So does my father . I'm already used to it .
Really ? That ' s a lot of money to pay for one room .
We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday !
We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve .
That's great . You can go take a look .
So what can we do ?
I will take your advice .
Well , I am just afraid they won't like my Chinese way of cooking .
Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards .
I can ' t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month .
That ' s where you ' re making a big mistake ! You can ' t just guess peoples ' likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like !
You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right .
OK . My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . I am leaving .
You know what . The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . They are supposed to call me this evening . If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ?
Your 3 . 5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million .
I ' ll pick you up here tomorrow .
Oh , how dreadful ! I ' m ever so sorry .
Not too rare .
No problem . So how have you been ?
Yes , of course I can drive you . So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ?
I ' ll be paying with cash .
ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip .
I am going to put a cuff on you to get a reading .
Just what ? Stop beating around the bush . Tell me what you want to know .
Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday .
I would think this was the least they could do .
So . this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ?
You know that my father is irritable .
I'm glad you like it . The bell is on the bedside . Just ring if you want anything . The room attendant speaks a little English . So I don't think you'll have any trouble .
Why am I always the last to know these things ?
Well , I think there's one across from the shopping center .
It doesn't look like we're on our way to Altadena .
Could I have your name , please ?
Hello , I would like a room please .
Would you please have a look at my report ? I hope the project meets your demand .
I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion .
Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 .
It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning .
How would your colleagues evaluate you ?
Would you please wait a minute ? I will get one for you at once .
How do we get started ?
No . Africans and African-Americans are different in many ways . Our food's different , too .
Remember to vacuum the floor and dust everything .
OK , OK , got it . By the way , what about the vacation policy ? Anything changed ?
Yes , only one travel bag .
You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that .
That would be 346 Euro .
But I ' m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ' t you ?
No , it's the number fifty-eight .
Where are we going now ?
I heard that Ann had divorced .
Why not ! These orders are not urgent . We could do it first thing tomorrow morning
Did you eat something strange ?
Yes . It looks terrific !
May I interest you in some dessert ?
Yes , of course . Will you come with receipt ?
May I ask what the core value of the company is ?
Certainly , what time will you come back ?
Ok , I ' ll have it sent to you immediately .
Very good ! I'm looking forward to it . Please give my best regards to John . And I wish you best luck !
It has a built-in hard-wired memory , but I like to use the 64MB media cards that come with it . I can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software . It takes fantastic pictures that I can either print out or E-mail to my friends .
Drink a lot of water and have a good rest . You'll be well soon .
We're on the same team here , Elvin . I'm being nice because we need to get along together .
Are you ready to order yet , sir ?
I'd like the first-class cabin for two . What's the fare ?
Which floor are we on now ?
We can't complain about the weather recently .
I'm sorry about that . What ' s your flight time ?
was it that crowded ?
Hello . Can I ask what steps I have to go through in applying for the job ?
Yes . At the end , we should conclude the letter with greetings .
OK . What about an evening riverboat tour ?
Oh look , they have some refreshments in here .
I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick .
The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .
Did you get any honors and awards at college ?
Who can't make it in your family ?
How were you sick ?
Yes , a suitcase and carry-on .
I see . Why did you choose our company ?
No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye .
Nine is a great time to get started . I'll see you on Saturday !
Room service . What can I do for you ?
But Steven , why don't you ask for a leave ? ... Steven , why don't you speak ? Are you still there ?
Do you have anything to declare ?
Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket .
hello ! How are you today ?
So , are you enjoying the performance so far ?
You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming .
OK . Can I see the room now ?
Not at all . No hidden fees or surcharges , it is a flat monthly rate .
Definitely , I ' m really sorry .
That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?
Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only .
No , I'm going back to America to visit . I'm from America , but I don't live there now . I live in Taichung .
I made strawberry shortcake .
For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
What's her last name ?
Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ' t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so yo
Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ' s easy to go anywhere from here and it ' s near the place where I work ?
Sorry . No . You need to transfer to a connect flight in the middle .
Um , which of them is the better typist ?
Oh , congratulations ! Sounds like you ' Ve found your soul mate .
Well , as I said they ' re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance . They ' re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential . I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me . Oh , and they offer six weeks ' vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ' m totally going to cash in on that .
Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that .
It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ?
Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it .
I've never been better , thanks .
Great . How much is this going to cost ?
Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ?
where will you be staying ?
Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ' s not just a big vacation , you know .
I am going to attend an interview .
The stars look so much closer after it rains .
Do you think we ' ll need our overcoats ?
It's good , and it's easy to make .
Go back to sleep then , but only five more minutes .
Good morning . I want to post this letter . Can you tell me what the postage is ?
Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one .
I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex .
That's sad , but have you gone to the movies recently ?
that's right . I thought I'd come back to buy some more souvenirs .
Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German .
We'd like to rent a flat near the university .
But they're purple . I prefer a brown set .
That's great , exactly what I need to know . Thanks .
But it ' s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ' t it ?
It ' s just what I want . I think I am ready to sign .
Thank you very much for your evaluation . I also like this job very much .
People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child .
I don't know about you , but I'm famished . Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ?
At first , I thought it was me .
That ' s really interesting . you have to play for me some time .
yes , I graduated with a BA in English from Qingdao University .
We're sure we will . And welcome to our corporation next year . We're expecting you .
OK . How much is the deposit ?
Good , as long as you understand that .
How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ?
No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation .
I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday .
I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future .
Sure Paula , shoot !
Oh , I see . By the way , what shall I do if changes in altitude create pressure on the ears ?
James Cameron , of course .
Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major .
I want to finish my degree in four years . So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year . She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate . She didn't know about them .
Is it all right to smoke on the bus ?
Thank you for telling me that .
Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . If the company is happy with my work , then , I think I would like to consider other positions in the company .
Don ' t you think it ' s a bit cold for that ?
So they kept you at the station ?
Yes . The television is not working properly .
In cash . How much is the total charge ?
Well , since there are some small square tables , could we put two tables together ?
Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ?
Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here .
I'm fine . How about yourself ?
Room Service . May I help you ?
Yes , I have nothing to do .
Oh ... why ?
So , I want to recommend them for a raise . Fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and David to be director of office .
You speak English very well .
Good afternoon , Johnson .
Why don't you put it in your salad ?
Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us .
I see . I will try my best to do the job well .
Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he return . he has my number .
Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ?
I am new to the work and I will appreciate your guidance !
What does a Chinese food have ?
My plane leaves at seven twenty-five .
Yes , just a little .
What colour is it ?
So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ?
Mark ? What were you up to yesterday ? I called you , but there wasn ' t anybody home .
I love history , but I ' Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
yeah , why not ? We've already pigged out as it is !
I hope you like it .
You see , . This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone .
No , thank you . Check please .
Cash , please .
Oh ! Is it too hot ? I'm sorry .
Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service .
Thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place .
It doesn ' t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ' ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ' s a big one . You can ' t miss it .
Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill .
That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market .
They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items .
I don ' t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ' re shouting into your phone all the time ?
Hey , daughter , let me ask you something .
May , could you tell me how to solve this problem ?
I think they do , but I ' m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach .
Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives .
( The speaker in the airport says , ' Mr . Benjamin , we now have a boarding pass by the name of Benjamin at Lost and Found . ' ) Is that me ?
I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ?
Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie !
Well , sir , your insurance looks good , but I still have to write you a ticket .
Yes . Let ' s hold a birthday party for him , shall we ?
This is my house . Let me show you around it .
Harry was angry last night .
Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us .
I'm sorry . I must have made a mistake . I'll bring them for you at once .
Well , that's fine .
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
A return ticket , please .
OK . What are your strong points ?
Yes , take your time , please .
I ' m sorry , but how do I know the subway train is going south ?
Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 .
Why are you arresting me ?
Thank you . That ' s the result of exercise . By the way , do you work out ?
He didn't say , but he said he would call me .
Thank you so much . You're an expert .
No , I can ' t give it to you , let you have it for 12 . How about 14 ?
Great . I'll see you on the 7th .
The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night . You really want to dance to that ?
I get it , and thank you for your honesty .
I guess you ' re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe .
Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ?
You'll see . Oh , yeah , you'll see .
Hey , that's not fair . I did as much work as you .
I want to see a dentist .
Two people were injured .
Why don't we call them ?
I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ?
All right . Let's change it . Tomorrow afternoon at three . I am going to schedule it for that time and inform Mr . Liu about the change .
Do I ? Oh , no .
Can you give me some examples ?
( They get everything ready ) Here is a free table . Let's sit down . Help yourself to some fish please . Isn't it delicious and appetizing ?
Great , thanks .
no , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up .
No , I don't know where the bookstore is .
Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ?
Sure , no problem . Is your prescription ready ?
There are chemical materials , medicines , rubber , plastics and so on , many products and meet the domestic markets , we are also trying to meet international markets .
Don ' t worry . I will call Hanson , and ask him to help you .
Do you miss your old co-workers ?
Who knows ? You can't judge a book by its cover .
A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language .
Sorry to say you failed .
OK , well , I'm going to Europe . I guess 1,000 USD will be sufficient for now .
Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs .
Good idea , let's shop to we drop !
Dou you think I should join a basketball team , Mary ?
How much is all that ? I don ' t have much cash . Can I give you a check ?
Well , isn ' t there anything you want ?
The sun is shining .
Ditto , it doesn't look too expensive either .
Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities .
That sounds great ! Have you eaten ?
Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ?
You'll find it easily . Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on .
Are they going to be okay ?
Good morning , Mr . Montgomery . I've been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams .
I think I'll get a hat , too .
If you don't mind , you can use my camera and leave your address with me so I can send you the photos later .
Next June .
Very well . We ' Ve got everything taken care of already .
Thank you for choosing Bruno's . We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd .
I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap .
Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ' re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
Well , they should have called you !
That ' s possible , but I ' m not sure it would really happen like that .
Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason .
We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences .
But whenever we play , you just sit on the sand , drink beer , and watch the girls !
Did you see his face ?
Oh , you don ' t have to do that but it would be a great help .
I didn't know you had a cat . When did you get her ?
If you go to the breakfast aisle , you'll find the cereal there .
That's right , and turn left at the lights .
Thank you . How much will this cost ?
I don't know . What do you want to eat ?
If I survive the next six months .
It ' s harmful not only for yourself but for others .
Okay , so let ' s go over everything one more time . I really want you to get this job !
The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient .
Yes , we should .
Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done .
Your son was acting up in class .
Yes . Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it ?
Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket .
How dare you question my statement !
Is anything lost ?
It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ?
No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ' s casual , yet sophisticated .
What position ?
Would you like to exchange it ?
That is a really interesting fact .
Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ' s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base .
It may not be the best choice for me , but I am considering it .
Hello , Mr . Jones . We need to have a meeting to discuss our deal .
I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ' t know where I ' ll be after that .
Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin .
My pleasure , Mr . Green . I look forward to an excellent relationship with your company .
Well , it's quite different from the Chinese food .
Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world .
This is the last thing you need to do , but it may take a while for the papers to be processed .
Don ' t worry about it .
Where is our waitress anyway ?
All right . And would you like a salad ?
Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at 9 thirty .
That ' s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
You can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ' ll have to stand in line over here to post your package .
Good morning , sir . Have you reserved ?
It will be for business dinner . Reserve it under the name of Nova , the manager of Fashion Clothes Company .
Well . It ' s not all my fault , Anna ...
Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close . If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas . If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you .
I see . What else ?
Mr . Green , I ' d like to introduce you to Mr . Brown .
Yes . My eyes are small so I want to buy false eyelashes .
I'm a little nervous !
I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment .
Mmm , that sounds very interesting .
Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived !
Oh , o . k . Where ' s that ?
For a local call , just insert 35 cents in the slot and use it in the same way as your home phone . Inquiries are free from a public phone .
You are right about that .
No . I ' m a little worried about security . You never who ' s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ' t you worry about that ?
Since this is a sizeable order , I was thinking you might give us a 5 % discount .
It's a private garden .
Mommy , dinner , please !
Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year .
Fine , just fine . And you ?
Do you want to go to an Exhibition ? There ' s one of xinghai exhibitions hall tomorrow .
Certainly . Come and choose the cloth .
I've never done that before . Will I lose all my files ?
Oh , no ! What should I do now ?
Excellent . How is your English ability in reading and writing ?
In America , most gas stations are like this .
Well , most importantly the apartment is beautiful .
A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?
Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho !
I don't know .
Could you please look at the five men in this line-up ?
Pretty good . I ' Ve just had my new poems published .
Yes . I am sure I can . I was an English major in college .
Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive .
Not Yet . Listen to me . Don't forget to take your ID card with you .
It's very dark in here . Will you turn on the light ?
Who do you think will be elected ?
O . K . Your name please ?
Credit card please . Here you are .
It ' s the same color . It ' s green , too .
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue .
Sure . 416-790-1256 .
Oh , very good . I will buy this one .
A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible .
You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life .
You'll have to take a make-up exam in logic .
Of course ! How much would you like to spend on your meal ?
That is D-A-V-I-D , W-H-I-T-E .
Excuse me . I was wondering how to order office supplies .
I think there's been a misunderstanding !
Where is the fitting room ? I don't see it .
Good . Just bring it back and we'll total it together .
Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories .
My name is Benjamin , and I live in Broad-Gate Street 2101 .
Then you will be in line for a doom .
I have to talk to you !
Certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve .
That's fine . Maybe you should be more careful .
Well , I know a little Italian .
Is it important ?
Then what about the wire ?
Admit it . You just think of Mussolini .
Yes , I do . This one is very old now .
I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off .
Yes , you have a good eye for materials .
Hey , slow down . I'll tell you more while playing .
How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return !
Just a second . I'll go get some . Then you need to send the file . Make sure you choose the right printer . We have a few here and you're hooked up to all of them .
I want a pair of enameled leather shoes in size 30 .
No , I'd like to go alone .
I attended Suzhou University .
My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful .
did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ?
Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .
I think I am extroverted .
I want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . And I believe me trip here will be meaningful and our cooperation will go deeper and stabler in near future . Through the communication , we can know more about each other . Thank you so much for your consideration .
Don't be silly .
Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life .
Yes , what a nice dinner that was !
ok , then count me in . where will we stay ?
But I prefer warm weather .
Well . My watch says five past two . But it ' s no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days .
Yes . When is the next train to New York City ?
Why is little Billy crying ?
I can do that . Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ?
Have you found another job yet , Sally ?
Have you checked the database ?
No . The company pays for everything . Doesn't this sound very attractive ? This is why our company can always get the best employees !
And ?
You did a horrible job on my hair .
It happens quite often , actually . Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ...
I'm absolutely sure I'm right .
I can't believe it . My parents never beat me .
I ' m a bit worried about you going shopping by yourself this afternoon .
The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets .
Actually , I study a lot less here than I did in Taiwan ! My classes are great , though . Sociology is the perfect major for me .
Are we losing or gaining a day on the way to America ?
That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office .
I have to go now . I don't want to be late .
I think that it is around 600 .
Well , what about $ 8 ? Take it or leave it .
All right . ... What's the date today , please ?
Some of the scenes moved me into tears .
This way please . First , we should clean your face with our clarifying cream . And then we use the massage cream . Next do the massage . I hope that you can feel comfortable .
Do you think it will suit me ?
sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier .
Sure . How many would you like ?
That's it . By the way when can I get it back ?
It is so wonderful that this transaction turned out to be the satisfaction of both parties .
It's close coming up at the end of this month . That will be no more than 15 days from now on .
So do I .
This could become a very expensive trip to the beauty parlor !
And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !
Yes , right , certainly . Here you go .
What about you ?
Yes , sir . We try to anticipate all our guests ' needs , including fitness .
I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday .
Pardon , where to , sir ?
What's the date today ?
Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it .
That's not so bad .
I need to speak to an attorney regarding filing corporate govemance .
I want to invite you to go to the movies .
Alright . At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends .
I ' d like to try the salty ones . Where does that strange smell come from ?
Are you being served , madam ?
Ok . Take care .
Mr . Jackson , I've drafted a schedule for your business trip next week . You may have a look .
Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least .
Working for your company ! As the top administrative assistant in your firm !
David , what do you want to do after graduation ?
you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ' t very usually effective .
It spoiled my painting !
I ' ll take this one .
OK . A reservation for eight at7 : 30 , Room 208 . Please don't be more than half hour late , or we will have to give it to other guests .
No , she ' s average .
I want my hair to be only a few inches long .
I am sorry , sir . But may I see your driver's license and insurance policy , PLS ? I have to give you a ticket .
Did you put the blue bin out on the street ?
Hello , Doctor .
This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ?
They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
Are you kidding ?
I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor .
It ' s from NYU .
Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here .
No , thank you . I think it's enough for dinner .
Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well .
What would you reckon the taxing increases ?
Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study
Oh , yes , I worked there for two years , just graduated from college .
Mr . Mass , here is a gift for you .
Certainly . When do you want to travel ?
sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive .
Did you hear about last night's blackout ?
You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too .
Oh , hop in .
Hmm . Is that true ?
Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning ?
Good afternoon , may I help you ?
Excuse me , how can I get special discount coupons ?
What a wonderful game !
Yes . It is just round the corner . Oh , can you see the London Eye ? Look straight and to your right .
That ' s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ?
Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ?
If you could , please . That would be wonderful , thanks .
The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk .
Yes . She goes three times a week .
Yes , I am new .
Hi . This is the Customer Service . How can I help you ?
Which date would that be ?
Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it .
And this is your company's head office ?
When you need an apartment , where do you look for one ?
Hi , John , this is Mary , your tenant up in Lincoln Park .
Have you been a class leader ?
My mom says it has a lot of fat . I also suggest you do not eat so many fried things .
For the night of April 18th , for one night .
I'm fine for now , thanks .
He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ?
Only one , please .
Drop 50 cents in the box , please .
I don't want to lose all my money .
Oh , we always go to the movies . Can ' t we do something different ?
My husband is betting on France .
You ' re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ' t it ?
What about Mao Tai , one of the most famous liquors in China ? It's good indeed . It never goes to the head .
I prefer TV play to football .
OK . I will catch you later .
Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you .
It ' s so unreliable . I ' Ve been late for my meetings all this week .
Mary sings much better than Susan , doesn't she ?
In fact , we are beginning to make preparations .
Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price .
You moved to a new place ?
How did you spend the weekend ?
Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it .
Could you fill out this registration form , please ?
It's pretty cold and it often snows .
No problem .
But I really needed to be quick .
That sounds all right to us .
$ 520 a month ? We don ' t often have apartments as inexpensive as that . We have one apartment for $ 599 a month , on Seventh Avenue . It ' s near the station .
Never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
Give me a six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fry and a large Coke .
What about people who don ' t have a computer ?
Do you know how to play it ?
Well , it's completely changed my life .
It isn ' t too much .
So shall we have lunch together ? I ' d like to take you this time .
Is there something wrong ?
There are three of them , the Three Tenors .

I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ?

Do you often go back to see your parents .
I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight . How about another restaurant ?
It's simple . Just press the button , like this .
That's fine . I don't have much time to waste .
Hi , can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now ?
Oh , I ' m sorry . But this isn ' t a no-smoker , isn ' t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ?

No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ?
But if he doesn't listen to the teacher carefully , he won't learn anything .
Which color do you like ?

Yes . The light in this room is too dim . Please get me a brighter one .
You think it's funny . I'm terrified .
Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator .

You ' Ve got to be kidding me ! You ' re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?
Now , move the couch around and turn it upside down .
What ' s your ideal job ?
When does the bus come ?
Say , I like racquetball , too .
Sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too .
It wasn't a dirty movie . There wasn't even any nudity .
I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can .
What's your major ?
What kind of style are you getting done ? Can we match ?
What ever you say ?
How do you want your egg cooked ?
No , thanks all the same .
But the ref didn't whistle .
Jack , what do you think about the election ?
I am sorry you don't like it , sir . But that's just the special point of the dish .
I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left .
Cheers !
It's white gold .
Then what about you , Miss ?
And what kind of toothbrushes would you like ?
I like your new skirt .
For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g
I see . Talking with other people is very important .

Please hop in .
I'm not sure I'd want to give these people my credit card number .
Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ?
I ' m just not looking forward to cleaning it !
I think PCC is a lot better than here .
Here you go , thanks for everything .
From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future !
It's a secret .
Are the animals caged ?
Really ? Can't you stay a little longer ?
Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives .
I've really enjoyed your party , Lisa .
Of course , ma'am . Tell me where to go .
I can ' t decide what to do today .
A little , but not much .
Sounds good . Thanks .
OK , how about 12:30 PM ?
Don ' t worry . They are grown-ups .
Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold .
But I still love you .

Thanks . And how are your parents ?
Indeed , it is .

I think I will do that .
I won ' t know anybody at that school .
Do you have any year-end benefits ?
Do you want to buy something here ?
Thank you , sir . We look forward to serving you .
Sure , go ahead .
Yeah , It was scary but exhilarating .
But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more .
You , too ! See you tomorrow .
Looks like you ' re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that .
It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ?
Run around the track . In the morning I run for an hour , and in the afternoon I run around the building .
How short ?
American Express .
I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ' t breathe on me !
I cannot let anything happen to that tripod . Can you guarantee it will not be damaged if I check it in ?
The meeting room on the Fourth Floor needs to be swept . Jerry and Tom will help you at that time . Any questions ?
Good morning , Emma ! A lovely day , isn't it ?
What systems have you worked on ?
Really ? I love eccentric people .
I won't argue with that ! Let's go !
It doesn't matter . Forget it .
I am really not sure .

Oh , I see . Where's Mexico ?
Susan ? What brings you here today ?
I don't really feel like a walk .

Ah yes , I'd like to book two rooms for myself and my father . Could you tell me the cost of a single room per night ?

Do you take in students ?
Well , thank you very much , Mr . Sun . I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible . Goodbye .
May I work in sales department ?
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
Well , I ' m going to write a letter of complaint .
I guess you could choose that if you wanted .
Your daughter should get straight A's from now on . Good-bye .
It really depends on when and how long .
I'll take it , I'd also like to buy some chocolate .
I am going to give you an end-of-the-unit test this Friday . Please be prepared for it .
I see ...
How long was she employed with your company ?
Adding in your expenses , I calculate that you can spend three hundred thousand on a house .
My friend Jane is very beautiful .
I thought I asked you to clean your room earlier .
Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well .
Where can I take it ?
I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too .
Yes . We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! OK . I ' m really to do the meat . Should I cook it over a low flame ?
I thought you had trouble with Clive !
Why is a DVD better than a VCR ?
I understand , I guess .
It's Nugent , N-U-G-E-N-T , but just call me Ted .
Fine , thanks .
The radio says it'll be fine .
I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air .
Why not start with the most interesting one ?
Great . What do you suggest we see ?
Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ' t sound too good at all . Ok , I ' m going to set you up with a bunch o
I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ' s on sale , isn't it ?
If it's convenient for you , Mr . Wu would like to invite you to the banquet in honor of you in the evening .
I stayed in L . A . and it was sunny the entire weekend . We spent most of the time at home but we did go see King Kong on Christmas day .
Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion .
It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment .
Can it go in an envelop ?
You could always get a burger , and I can get a pizza .
Good morning . Is this where I can get a library card issued to me ?
that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .

Yes , I've looked everywhere in my room and I can ' t find it .
Then shall we make preparations together ?
In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded .
You don't sound too excited about going to your reunion .
But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ?
Tuesday night is when we need the reservation for .
How come you have a locker but I don't ?
Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
That ' s a little expensive .
Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible .
We're having some friends over . What are you doing ?
Just a little . Has your toothache gone now ?
I hear they have very nice stuff .
I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates .
Our car is in the parking lot . We've booked a room for you . I will take you to the hotel soon . Let's go .
You always work too hard , Jim . As the saying goes , all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . You should spare some time for a rest .
That's my wife !
Hand-baggage is not to be weighed , sir ... I'm sorry , sir , you're 25 kilos overweight . I'm afraid there'll be an excess luggage charge , sir .
It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen .
Is this Mr David Richton ?
But I am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets .
Excuse me , do you know the shortcut to the Lincoln park ?
I would like to book a table for six tonight .
And Merry Christmas !
I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ' s all junk food !
Unfortunately , I missed a chance to see a classic movie .
Oh , I don't need to do that . I'll be staying with friends
I don't see much difference , anyway .
We have Volkswagen , Pinto , Plymouth and Datsun .
Good , you are welcome .
Well , I don't think I want it .
I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on .
Now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special .
Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ?
I see . What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans .
What's all the security check about , Jimmy ? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ?
He's still pretty sick .
Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background .
That's right . How nice to see you again .
soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too .
Sounds dangerous .
OK , I see . Thank you very much .
Fine , well just send the form to us and we will let you know as soon as your supplies come in . Have a good day !
Don't worry about it . I need to have something done about those bushes .
Luckily that was nothing serious .
We will be checking for blood sugar , cholesterol , and white blood cell count .
Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ...
By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination .
Wow , my son is so clever .
Oh , I see . Thank you very much .
Do you like a package tour or to travel alone ?
yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon .
Sure , I have to go anyway . But the first place you need to go is immigration office . They ' ll check your ticket , passport , visa and immunization record book . After that we can go to the baggage claim area .
No , early saturday morning .
I couldn't agree more .
A double room sounds great .
I'll take your temperature . How long have you been feeling ill ?
yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines .
So let me show you some of our DVD players . In my opinion , DVD is the wave of the future .
That's true . But I just love it . Come here !
You can go and ask your father .
Yeah , that's fine . Next Friday at 12 at Garden Hotel . I'll look forward to it .
So , now I need your help again , if you don't mind . I'm taking a date to a restaurant .
Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set .
What do you think of your own qualification ?
How about the cinema ?
Probably . People's consumptive habit is changing rapidly because of the internet .
I got the message . I am quitting .
if you're worried about money , the cost of living is lowest in America . However , if you go to Oxford University , you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future .
Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby !
I don ' t know . I don ' t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon .
Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ?
The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ?
I hope this won ' t be our last meeting .
what do you mean ?
Since last night .
Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you .
My hard drive crashed .
sounds good . I'll see you then !
Mr . : The school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch .
Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan .
You should make a salad like that .
Is this the right bus for the Grand Hotel ?
Excuse me , do you go to the Central Park ?
At least you know what American women generally like in a man .
Well , pretty good .
Wait a minute , My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to theatre . I ' Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . We ' d better have breakfast now . and meet him later .
The one next to the telephone .
I don't think he'll like it . He prefers simple styles .
If you want to ask for leave , you should get the approval from the manager in charge of your department .
Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here .
There's obviously a problem with your connection .
C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
You could get him a tie .
Well , we have some nice sugar .
Economy , please .
It's 500 dollars , not including ground transportation fares between the airport and downtown .
Okay , I'll get the car out of the garage .
Wait ... What !
I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ' s a real let-down .
I want to be here tomorrow . What are your business hours ?
Not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . The next thing is to select the service .
Well , I ' Ve looked over your resume , Mr . Peepers .
At 7:30 p . m .
Oh , Mary , come in , please . I'm so happy to see you .
Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ' s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard .
No , you can not . It is dangerous .
Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .
What are we doing ?
What do you do on that day ?
At 8 o'clock .
I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire .
But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I'm nearly 17 .
Roast beef , of course . That's what I ordered .
Your passport , please .
It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ' s harder to make peace between countries .
Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over .
All right . Can we make it another time ?
That ' s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ?
I'm glad you told me .
Quite well , thank you .
Yes , it's me .
Thank you very much for telling me all these things about the college .
That would be perfect .
She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth !
You shouldn't have used the machine . Did you lose your money ?
Is she fine now ?
Great ! Can you set the table ?
Pretty good . What brings you here ?
The food there is wonderful .
Not yet . Can you give me some suggestions ?
Why don't you give them a suggestion ?
No , I think that's all that I need .
It's getting late . I'm afraid I have to leave . Thank you for a most wonderful evening .
Well , I still hate having a curfew .
Thank you . That's enough .
That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work .
Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage .
I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little .
Good day . Is this the Business Centre ?
I went on a trip with my family last week .
I'm completely lost . I'm looking for the Empire State Building .
Just let me sleep five more minutes .
But I also want ya to do me a favor .
not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
Oh , I have to check . Do you need anything else ?
pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it .
Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ?
Is it possible to get a beer ?
What subject did you major in at university ?
Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient .
Check , please .
Don't worry . There are so many people . We will join the touring party .
I'm going to sweep the floor first .
Certainly . That shouldn't be a problem . Tell me , do you have a Basic Account with us ?
Certainly , which color do you want to dye it ?
Apparently , you have a bench warrant .
You know , I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days .
No , not for a few months .
We may be sold out of them . Let me check the back . ( The clerk goes to the storeroom , returning a few minutes later . ) I'm afraid we're out of stock . Would you like a rain check ?
Ok , now could you fill out this registration form ?
Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers .
So you're a big fan , eh ?
Ok . I'll keep my promise .
Thank you ! I will . When and where will the dinner be ?
I couldn't have asked for more .
You don ' t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort .
Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ' re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ?
Hey , May , how are you doing ?
I haven ' t decided yet .
Yes , you can . The best way is to first select the company you want to buy from , then we can help you to do it . Do you have a Current Account here ?
yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price , but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th
Really ? What jobs are they ?
It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company .
Kate , what do you like to do tonight ? Do you often go to the movies ?
So go then .
Yes . Babies under six months are free of charge . We offer 50 % discount to children under 7 . How old are your children ?
Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see is that our expenses are through the roof .
I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ?
Hmm . I have only one best friend .
Thank you . The change , sir .
Oh , hi . Thanks for getting back to me quickly .
Yeah , and I love your cooking .
Regardless , all you had to do was give a call .
If necessary there will be . Any other questions ?
Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper .
Alright . But will we sing ?
YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span .
What ' s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ?
Yes , I have , and three times in total .
Good , let's go for a drive .
Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell .
Thanks very much and you're very eloquent .
That ' s great .
Oh , to rent .
May I please speak to Robert ?
I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little .
In the downtown , near the square .
Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium !
Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ' Ve told me .
In that case , I won ' t keep you . Remember to give me a call .
Mary , I think we should stop seeing each other .
No problem . We'll give you both calls .
bye !
Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann .
I don't want to miss it today .
it sounds like you've got a perfect plan .
I want to open a checking account .
It's right past that last building on the left . Do you want me to go with you ?
The order was in good shape when it left out factory .
As you like .
Thank you . I'm going to bed .
It means he ' s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive .
Well , my dear . I didn't believe either . But got it straight form the horse's mouth . David called me this morning .
I love flowers , you know . Thank you very much .
Will you be paying some of that off today ?
Are you crying ?
No . I'm still single .
I hear many people here speak French .
Very good . If you enter this company , what department would you like to work in ?
Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes . You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .
OK . What sort of agent , exactly ?
Like what ?
I major in Japanese .
What took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago !
It ' s true . But I can ' t show my abilities .
Let me see . Oh , yes . We have your reservation number .
What kind of room would you like , Ma ' am ? We got single rooms , double rooms , standard rooms , suites and deluxe suites .
Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties .
I have a driver's license , and two years of driving experience .
May I ask you a few questions about insurance ?
I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ?
Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ' t full of apartment blocks .
No , I haven't began my preparations .
I appreciate your understanding .
Good . Let's take a look !
I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account .
Love me , love my dog . He ' s a sensible kind man .
Yes , that happens .
And what about the number of people on the streets ?
Would it be convenient to see the room ?
I work at a hospital .
I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ?
Has the train come yet ?
You can get that type of apartment for around fifteen hundred dollars a month .
Not only does it centralise management , it also increases the efficiency of funds . We have testimonials from various companies who are very happy with the service .
Excuse me , may I have the bill , please ?
I want it taken from my checking account .
It ' s my mother . She ' s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father .
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ?
Hi , have you got the exact number of people who are going take part in this activity ?
Yeah , my name is Nandu .
Don't make a fuss . The price is rising
What position did you play ?
Who ' s your favourite player ?
Excuse me . When's the next bus ?
Yes . I am ready .
Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ?
I only had nine little problems here . Other than that , I enjoyed my stay , and I loved the city .
Could I ask the company for the housing ?
Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I'm also in the process of writing my first novel .
I wonder if you can help me . I'm looking for a room .
When can I do that ?
How regular ?
Did you go to the Magic Kingdom ?
Hi . are you new here ?
Huh ?
Can I have this prescription filled here ?
They are just been in friendly , when you are in Roman , do as the Romans do , that means you need to adapt to your enviroment .
I try to adapt myself .
Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .
Have you noticed what has changed ?
I want that .
She is now in a private school .
What does he look like ? Is he handsome ?
Are you having a problem with it ?
Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out .
More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly .
Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ?
Are you free this evening , Li ?
Mon and I got in another fight , Boris .
Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ?
All right . I'll make sure and remember .
What would happen if they started attacking you ?
Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu .
I'm not exactly sure , but it's not that expensive at all .
I wish you the best of luck .
Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ' ll show you to her office , right this way .
Are you an art aficionado ?
Of course it is . In fact , I'll even take the course with you if you want .
Congratulations on your first voting day .
Great , thank you .
I'm fine . Thank you .
There's some paperwork , but most of the time we put the information into our computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ?
I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ' d like to see Mr . Thomas , please .
Thank you . Do you have some other colors ?
Why don't we go shopping ?
It always hurts . I hate going .
Can you speak English ?
It ' s easy to say , but I will try .
Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ' s so great ! Thank you !
Are you out of your mind ?
Glad to hear your voice , David .
I heard it ' s a very good movie .
But I like its color .
In particular , I'm interested in marketing in the domestic field .
Yes , on a business trip . How about Yuu ?
The least expensive , but still fully functional . And we think that your factory needs to take measures to improve quality-control .
just today . I guess I forgot to mention it .
I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhaust but I can't sleep .
$ 90 .
No , thanks , maybe another time .
What is the difference ?
I need to get my internet fixed .
would you like to learn to tango Donar ?
I just did what I should have done .
Can we have two a joining double room , sir ?
You mean you got working experience , right ?
Sure , I ' m heading out myself . Enjoy your evening .
Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets .
Great , the price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash , check , or credit card ?
Wow ! You're really working up a storm !
I don't see anything wrong with it .
Where do I get off ?
What kinds of questions did she ask you ?
If I placed an order now , how long would it be before I got delivery ?
Wow . What fillings do you recommend ?
What's your best price for that item ?
What should I do ?
I'm really sick of you .
Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ?
I haven ' t seen you in a while . How have you been ?
Sure ! You should do anything you can to improve your English .
There is a long list of those things forbidden , including explosives , gum opium and precious cultural relies and so on .
That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident .
Can I draw my tax back here ?
Are you still working ?
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ?
Wow , it's already 10:00 AM . He must have been up late last night .
Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ?
How may I help you ?
Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful !
Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ?
Well then , I'll keep you in the loop . Thank you for your help today .
How long will it take ?
Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite .
Hello and welcome . How may I be of service ?
It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold .
That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful .
Sure . We'll be there in a few minutes .
Let's just rent one this time . The AC is broken in the truck , remember ?
Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things .
What are you going to do there ?
Bingo ! I never thought about that before . I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know .
Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants .
How's the weather there today ?
Why have you changed your job so frequently ?
Never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again .
How should I take this medicine ?
I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ?
Can you make a suit for me to order ?
Is skating interesting ?
He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep .
Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle .
You can keep the cat , but you should keep it away from me .
Ok . Choose the card which you like best , and fill in the following blanks with both your and your friend's names and e-mail addresses .
Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ?
Yes , it has . We ' re going to target the business community through business magazine .
What fruits are in season right now ?
When do the playoffs start ?
I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .
Please wait a minute , sir .
Really ? You must like tango , right ?
Please take me to this address .
Last time I wore extra small was when I was in fifth grade .
That's not a problem . You can use that service wherever you are , it doesn't matter which country you are in at the time .
My vote is personal .
The weather is good now , but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon .
My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend .
Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday . So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend .
No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants .
No . That ' s everything . Thank you .
We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece -- it ' s both glamorous yet functional . If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her .
I have a leaky pipe .
Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester . And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet .
Hello ? This is Steven . I'd like to speak to Mr . Brown , please .
Don't you know ? Tomorrow is Father's Day .
I know what she would like---some whitening cream .
I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging .
Is the view going to be ok ?
Circle or stalls ?
July , 2006 .
No , you ' re kidding . I ' m not taking it seriously .
Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning .
Hi , is this Sue ?
She has blond hair and blue eyes .
I like the freedom of summer with no school .
You are right .
So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything .
Does it have questions about foreign language films ? There's hardly any American films worth watching .
Well , they ' re older , and they don ' t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ' t like that style at all , and they don ' t like dealing with people who dress like that at work .
Sure , what ' s up ?
I won't .
Why are you nervous ?
Yes , of course . Is American Express okay ?
All right . How about this black skirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral !
Yeah , you need to take advantage of it within its expiry date .
I certainly hope so , I am about to stop doing business with your office .
Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ?
They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in .
What breakfast foods ?
Your job includes paper filing a lot . Anc you will have to check and fill the stationer cabinet regularly . Besides , you have to reserve the meeting room in advance if the are any important visitors .
You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes .
But we ' Ve only been on the road for ten minutes .
Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never get it .
By who ?
Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms .
Tomorrow night , then ?
You never know . Maybe he's just an innocent , lonely guy ...
The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day .
I was doing quite well at college . I completed my MBA degree in international trade with first-class honors .
I'm always interested in how , but seldom pay much attention to who .
Yes , sir . I remember it . But our Chinese usually celebrate the New Year on lunar calendar .
Well , we have a tradition in my family ...
Please wait a second . I'll get it for you .
Really , well , OK . Get the receipts out .
OK . It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
Oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ?
I'll pay cash , thank you .
Did somebody hit you ? Or did you just fall ?
I'm going to get a snack .
OK , let's get the ball rolling on this .
And take a good rest for a few days .
I think so . Aren't the four Cs , cut , clarity , carat and color .
You ' re welcome . Have a nice trip .
I hope before the end of the month .
Nancy Brown . My phone number ' s 709 678 5634 . Nancy Brown .
Friday sounds good .
Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve .
No . But I ' m sure she is a good girl . My sixth sense tells me so .
What ' s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack .
About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . I was very embarrassed .
I will . See you later .
Of course . Here you are . Can I take your order now ?
I'm not sure of that . Do you know ?
Well , I feel a little tired .
If you'd like further information on this , there ' s a guidebook in several languages on sale at the information desk .
Welcome to my shop next time .
What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ' mon , ref !
That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ' ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all .
I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal . But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .
Can I read it when you're finished ?
What did David do yesterday ? Did he and Judy go dancing ?
Oh , no problem . Here's the lid that comes with the pan .
It's too expensive . Can you come down a little ?
it's a kind of rice ball that is made in Malaysia . What about you ?
Exactly five dollars .
Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it .
We scored six goals .
I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players .
Would you prefer our cocktail -- Shanghai cocktail ? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients .
That was quick .
Why do you stop me ?
I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year .
Sure , sir . Have you brought the cloth ?
I don't think I forgot anything .
I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ?
That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ?
She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her .
She's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down .
Good morning , Miss .
What's this then ?
Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents .
Why aren't you at work ?
You won't believe it , but it was really cheap .
But what's a movie without munchies ?
Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside .
What lovely weather !
That is awesome . Congratulations ! I know you can make it .
Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation .
Good . I was thinking that I ' d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate .
That is good . He can leave you alone this time .
I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo as the car .
Hi Mike , how are you doing ?
How many years have you had the drivers license ?
Hello , this is Steven . Is that Mrs . Wang ? I'm just calling to follow up about the status of the personnel manager position .
Are you planning on voting ?
We are on our way . I think our first stop is Buckingham Palace .
No rush . You can give it back whenever you have it .
Good morning . I'd like to buy tickets to Paris .
I will call them this afternoon , thanks .
The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .
Yes , I've got it .
no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon .
I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ' ll see .
Oh , I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat . Have you had lunch yet ?
Good . Thank you very much .
I suppose you need the whiteboard set up .
Sure . Can you get it yourself , it ' s in the refrigerator .
Hello , Daniel . What can I do for you ?
I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses !
I've never been , but I may start shopping there .
I asked you if you wanted some help .
Yes . If people can not communicate with each other easily , they can not understand each other's way of thinking .
If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things .
You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .
Yeah , it ' s 30 percent off the regular price .
Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead ?
I have a high fever and a bad headache .
What time would you like your table ?
And not expensive either .
Never ! He ' s over 80 , isn ' t he ?
The day after tomorrow .
That's the transfer completed . Can I do anything else for you today ?
I want to say goodbye to everyone .
Which language do you speak ?
No , he walks . He likes walking . He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together .
That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases .
Good . So , which is your top choice ?
You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already .
It is my pleasure to see you off .
Yes , it ' s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ' s also been making a high-pitch noise when it ' s in use .
Why don't we spend this vacation earning our tuition ?
Certainly . It's right over there .
I'm very hungry , Donald . What can I eat ?
Which stop do I get off on ?
My condolences .
hey , Lily , what are you doing ?
Really ? I am glad to meet you .
I'm sorry . What's your name again ?
yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty .
It's getting late , Mary .
I've not known . Perhaps , I've got a bad memory .
Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man .
Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China .
Then , you are to walk to work .
Would you like a shave ?
The office is in front of you as you cross the quad . The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be .
It took three of us to move it .
What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ?
A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood .
Certainly . How do you like to have it made ?
They're doing a seventeenth-century program .
Who was the professor ?
We went to the coast . It's really a nice place for camping , really good time around the fire singing and dancing .
Yes I am . I got married five years ago .
But my father did not . He didn't have much time .
I hope it stays like this .
Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ?
I got on about fifteen minutes ago .
I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?
It ' s that popular ?
What school did you transfer from ?
Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops .
Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work .
Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year .
That's right . You won't have that problem with DEL .
A cold-wave , please .
Is the girl in red your girlfriend ?
Yes . Did you forget ?
Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?
Things change every minute .
Where are you going this summer vacation ?
About 2 o ' clock in the morning .
Would that be a Fixed Deposit or a Current Deposit ?
Mr . Smith often talked about you .
Will I be getting any help ?
Alright . I'll send someone over tomorrow .
She said I couldn ' t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is .
Ok , who is that girl ?
Is it under warranty ?
What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ?
May I leave message ?
What part hurts ?
We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % .
I had fun talking to you .
That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper .
Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy .
How about coffee down the street ?
Ah hah . Thought you were't drinking .
Do you have concert halls in your city ?
Now , that's a price that I like .
That'll be lovely . Where are you going ?
Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft .
Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ' t just stand there ! Come and take a seat !
That ' s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit .
Would you like to book a table , sir ?
Technically , yes .
Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ?
I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain .
I got a raise .
Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower .
Oh , I know it . It is included in extreme sports . I think it's too dangerous for me .
do you like playing games ?
Let me see it ! It's so small !
I don't need to leave until the very end of class .
What's your title in the company ?
Does this hotel have a pool ?
By subway .
He is so humorous .
All right . Let's see when the next movie is playing ?
it ' s a beautiful city , but I think it ' s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ?
I am thinking about resigning from my current job .
Some high speed chase scene , I think .
actually , could I have some milk with that ?
Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that .
I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?
Good evening , ma'am . May I help you ?
Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ?
Pretty well , I think .
Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ?
I ' Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ' s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye .
You can take a 15 - inch Pro home right now for only $ 2,100 .
Well , I like to play the piano .
Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ?
I'm surprised . He does't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ?
How long will the trip take ?
So how have you been ?
A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
Of course , come in .
Yes . Are you ?
Probably nothing .
I already know . Start cooking .
Are you the loan officer of this bank ?
Hello , Frank .
How many payment methods are there ?
Okay , thanks very much .
Oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling .
I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ?
Good news ! I ' ll be glad to . When do you need it ?
Is it a family thing or just friends ?
Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work .
You're Mary , right ?
What do you think of your personality ?
I think I need some iced water , too . Is there an extra charge for that ?
Hi , Walter !
Well , did you want to go see a movie with me ?
I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company .
It is not easy to improve my English .
Housekeeping , may I help you ?
Thanks . And of course , could you fill in the exchange form ?
Which one of these is the gas pedal ?
I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell .
What's this city famous for ?
We're in big trouble , Jason . Nick is beating us by a long shot .
I ' m excited to speak to a candidate .
OK . Just wait where you are . I'll send someone up to help you .
Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom .
What did you do last night ?
Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?
Whoa . Now I'm awake ! Zina has a secret admirer .
I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ?
Yes . The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting .
Yeah , though I don't think her acting skills are that great .
That's a good idea , except I want to go out , not stay in . Something else , maybe ?
Yes , please . I'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates .
Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?
I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie .
I see . You've caught a bad cold . I'll give you a prescription .
I like the new shirt .
By the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too .
Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime .
Oh , that ' s alright .
I have one ten-day tour that is still available . It will depart from New York on December 24th .
I want to send this package to Los Angeles , please .
No problem . Step in , please .
After you .
Would you like any tea , dear ?
I almost did ! Actually , I don't know that much about coffee , even though I sell it .
Hi , United Airlines ? This is Elizabeth parks calling . I have a reservation on the 2:30 p . m . flight to Shanghai this afternoon .
Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ?
Sure , I've had the steak and the lobster before . They're both very good .
Is this dress made of pure silk ?
I see . And does your son have a VCR now ?
Do you know who that tall man is ?
Yes , actually it ' s my second visit . I was there last October .
I ' ll do my best .
Good morning , Mr . Wilson . I ' m calling to confirm the date of the next interview program .
Sure thing . Do you want me to give you a ride home ?
Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ?
Could you look for me ?
Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me .
What is on the program ?
Absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade .
Well , have you heard of Peking Duck ? it's a local specialty .
Red restaurant . Do you want to make a reservation ?
Yes , I did .
At what address , sir ?
Sure . Show me your receipt , please .
Just a moment , please . Oh , yes . One twin and one single . Is that right ?
Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ?
It ' s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ' s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much !
I'm Li Ming from CITS . Glad to see you .
Thank you . Here's your key and receipt . Your room number is 408 . A porter will take your luggage to your room . The elevator is just around the corner .
Do you have a package that includes all the movie channels with the basic channels also ?
personally , I think it ' d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ' t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
How should I dress for the party ?
You must have seen some other kind of bird .
My last name is Foster . Thank you for the reservation .
Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius .
They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen .
Not at all . I was born in Madrid , but I came to the States when I was a teenager .
You do ? I just bought this outfit a couple days ago .
Yes , 20 yuan for each .
Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ' re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ' t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ' s check for their guest .
All right . Could I have it gift-wrapped , please ?
Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections .
No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work .
How nice it is here .
I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ' t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day .
All right , all right . I understand .
Do you have medical insurance ?
Well . Obviously , you won ' t want All Risks cover .
Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork .
No , thanks . I'm in a hurry . How much is it ?
I realize that . We don't have anytime to waste . I can put you down for 9
Yes , I could sing it when I was very young .
I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest !
It doesn't matter right now , either one would be OK .
It's a pleasure to meet you . My name is Lucy .
What's your relationship with the victim ?
I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news .
I made an appointment for a perm at 3 o'clock .
Great , let's go !
The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume .
Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ?
I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump .
What is the rate ?
May I please speak to Tom ?
No . I'm busy then too . I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road . Are you free on Thursday afternoon ?
What about the quality of the pictures ?
Here is your ticket . Let's get in the museum .
I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass .
I ' d like to , but there ' s her boyfriend . He ' s very broad-shouldered .
Because you're from a foreign country . The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills .
I went out with Leo last night . It was really exciting .
Five hundred and thirty yuan altogether including charges for service .
You're in luck today because the roses are on sale .
Dad and mom ?
Maybe you need a vacation or something , or maybe a bonus .
Yes , I ' ll pay for the call . Put her through , please .
Hello , is that Miss Lan ? This is Nina with Huawei Corp .
But how can I prevent a deficit ?
She's a real turn-on , alright ?
Organic ? What ' s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ?
I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ?
My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him .
Thank you for reminding me . Well , please give me a glass of brandy and I will pay for it .
Do you want to study together ?
Why not just give them money in red envelopes ? That would be much easier .
Yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway .
How long have you been studying English ?
The radio has too many comerials .
Excuse me , I am a transit passenger for flight PB965 , can you tell me where to go ?
And where are we going to go ?
Thank you so much for interviewing me this evening .
Just a minute please . I ' ll make a call to the HR office .
Oh , no , that's way too heavy a pan for me .
The statue has for a century acted as a figurehead for the American Dream .
Hold on a sec , his name is David ?
The more you work , the more you earn .
It ' s about time .
I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week .
Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers .
Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5 . 90 and my Pizza was £ 8 . 25 .
Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ' s going ' on ?
You can super-size your meal for only 39 cents extra .
Really , hmmmm . Erm , well , could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself ?
part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily .
It is hard to tell . Maybe it is because you're not resourceful enough to be a manager .
What were you thinking ?
How could it be ? They are due two weeks later .
Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
You're welcome . Have a nice day !
One thousand yuan , please . By the way , what is today's exchange quotation ?
Are you ready for a second ?
I bet AC Milan will lose .
Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything .
That's the most important thing .
Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation .
Bill , please .
Unfortunately , yes .
It takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ' ll probably be about an hour ' s wait .
Good morning ! May I help you ?
Ah ! Not on me ! Ow !
Alright . We can go later then .
What's your email address ?
It looks nice .
Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ?
I'm sorry to say " No . "
I got it . Mary Lin .
Sounds perfect . I'll take the pink one . Can you pack it for me ?
Sure , I ' ll have a Corona .
you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ?
Thanks . You too !
Well , trains are frequent and come on time .
Our quoted price includes the software system , installation , 3 day training seminar and ongoing troubleshooting . There are no hidden costs .
That's what I understand .
Dinner ? Where ?
Thank you . I'll wash them .
Umm , I think I would be hard to find something in that range in this area . You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest .
Ok ! You know you're always welcome here . Did you enjoy your stay ?
Take your mind off it . Look , Crys . This magazine is on China's top ten beauties !
My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race .
I'd like a coke .
I agree . And some cartoons are entertaining even for adults .
Your dog is really cute . What's his name ?
No , thank you . They are already tagged with my name and address .
It's such a hot season , isn't it ? May I suggest thinning out the top ?
So you are leaving two weeks from now ?
Are you nervous about meeting up with your ex , Femi ?
Yes , next March .
OK , guys . Here's the plan . Get the ball to the goal , and keep it away from Rich and Taylor !
That would be easy .
That sounds good . I've missed you my friend .
No , I ' d rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
How have you been getting on with your studies so far ?
Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ?
But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ?
Yes , I will . I should learn more from you . After all I am green hand on it .
In that case , let me tell you about some alternatives .
One dollar . Drop it in the box . Move to the rear of the bus . There are plenty of seats in the rear .
Okay , You are such a good talker .
Come on . You just have it once in a while , not every day . It will not harm you .
Jack and Stephanie .
only about 5 minutes .
It looks like some kind of mistake .
Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves .
No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ?
That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red .
I guess so .
that ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about tha
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot .
It would be better if you watched out for yourself . I might forget .
Yes . And you ?
Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't dance it well .
Where are you from ?
Of course , sir , I'll have a look in the back .
It's none of your business .
Yes . What do you want ?
I guess I will get water .
Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ?
You can deposit an initial amount of five dollars .
I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child
That's great , here you are . This is my passport .
I stayed up last night .
Do you need a single apartment , or is this for two people ?
really ? I didn't know that would be possible .
Really ? That's unusual for October , isn't it ?
I noticed your absence in class this morning .
Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam .
Well , how about fifty percent discount ? If so , I'll buy that fur coat .
It's August the thirteenth .
How many people are there in your party ?
Yes . The lights were out all night .
Let me wear you this diamond ring .
May I use your phone ?
I'll take this one .
Oh , sir . I lost my passport .
Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
Excuse me , I'm a little lost . Which bus do I take to get to Shi Da ?
Let's do that .
Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing !
I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet .
I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year !
Did you call me ?
Hey , don't forget to buy a suit for me .
I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job .
He makes me sick .
It ' s Mike , her boyfriend .
Good morning , Janice . Our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so I will allocate you some assignment .
I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table .
Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ?
I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .
You ' re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football .
You haven't heard about it ?
You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it !
How about Saturday morning ?
I'll have that too .
You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals , they have to be read within library .
Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London .
What exactly did you do at that company ?
The marriage only lasted about a year .
Oh , sure .
No , should I have ?
It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field .
I need the police .
Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ?
Well , thank you again for coming to see us . But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams .
Buy more and get more special discount coupons .
Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .
OK . Mr . Wang , may I send a room attendant to check it for you first ?
Did you hear something ?
I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college .
You can find one at the ticket office .
Sure . I will .
I'm sorry , sir . Exactly what is the problem ?
So do we have to stay in this English class forever ?
Because men like to cheat .
It's taking you forever to do my hair .
Yeah , I am of the same opinion .
Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends
How are you able to work at the polling place ?
So you wanna stay here ?
Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young .
I am confused a bit but I am sure that I can figure it out .
That is exactly what we're looking for .
Poor guy ! It's not fair . You forgot it too .
This is unfair .
Yes , I understand the numbers .
This paper absorbs water so quickly !
Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon .
I would like a single room with a bath for two nights . Can you help me to reserve a hotel room for me ?
OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ?
Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ?
Yes , I think so . I ' d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine .
Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ?
well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ' s fair to give them more time , don ' t you ?
Cow while Boots .
It ' s on Tuesdays and Fridays .
Straight , I think , and about average length .
Why would that be funny ?
I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent .
Ice cream , please .
what a pity .
May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ?
see . Here is the money .
Details ?
Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in ?
No , I live alone in a flat near my work place .
OK , we will send a repairman to your room right now .
Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ?
You're right . But if I get too thin , my mom will make me go to the hospital again .
How is your house hunting going ?
You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor .
I see . Do you love pets ?
Yes . I can lend you some .
I appreciate that .
There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street .
We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ' s the pitch , he hits it ! It ' s going , going , that ball is gone !
What's the weather like in winter ?
I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders .
Why do you like that type of music ?
Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ?
And why not ?
Hi Sam .
John , you look pale . What happened ?
Very good . Perhaps you'd like something else to go with the roses ?
Hello ! Could I speak to Sheerly Lim please ?
All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please .
If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call !
Can I have your key and room number , please ?
No , I'm not sure where they sell nice bedroom sets .
You aren ' t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ' t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ' s your friends party .
And then ?
I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ' s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes .
I feel exactly the same way with you .
Good morning , sweetie . You finally got up .
That's a relief for me and a misery for the children .
You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ?
We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays .
Why do you want to leave the company ?
Yes , I want to have a photo .
Hey ... as long as I ' m not alone on a Saturday night , I don ' t really care what I do !
Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this .
I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ?
I am having an exam at 9 o'clock , It's already 8 thirty .
That's good . Is the location easily accessible ?
Can I board the plane now ?
Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
Give me a quart of light oil .
Aren't the trousers a little too long ?
Yes , sir . We'll be there shortly .
I just want to study in a college , majoring in economics . I've had this dream for a long time .
If I were you , I would not put crime in their doing these thing . We should encourage our children to do what they like , so long as they are not far off track .
Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time .
The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them .
She definitely deserves 20 % for a tip .
Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ?

That would be WebTracker . We're heard they're almost ready . That's why we have to finish first .
I'd better see you there .
Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom . He is putting on grand airs .
Look , darling ! I can see a bench near that tree .
The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek . How do you explain that ?
What's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company .
You are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate .
Tell me then .
Ahahah , and I thought you were tired .
We may travel by sea . It's cheaper .
I think we'll buy this one . And I want you to try on this one too .
I'll tell you all about it another day .
really ? Why ?
Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company .
I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ?
You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ?
I'm sorry , but no . We used to have a trainer , but then he had an unfortunate accident .
I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group .
What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .
Terrific , that's a wonderful movie , I like it very much . Can I get tickets now for tomorrow ?
I see . Is this yours ?
It seems you're very fond of it .
Never mind , it doesn't matter .
The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check .
See you . Bye .
I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up .
I get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping blood versus at rest .
15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit .
That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ?
no . please sit down .
Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees .
Hi . I ' m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ?
What do you suggest I should see in New York ?
There are tons of other paintings that I think are better .
Have you thought about going in Dutch ?
You finished everything in there , sir ?
I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement .
Ugh !
To be honest , I'm a bit fed up .
You ' re sure we ' re not forgetting anything ?
That's great . I'll pick you up at eight .
Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well .
Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ?
Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ?
Yes , so it really doesn't matter who offers the money . The paper itself is profitable .
Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ?
I'll take care of the lunch then , and you can take care of the other plans . What time would you like to pick me up ?
How about we go to the flea market today ?
I attend an aerobic class three times a week .
Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners .
Mr . : I'm Mr . Rogers , your homeroom teacher .
I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car .
A single room from June 18th to 20th . Is that correct ?
Good answer , Miss Zhang-good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ?
Okay , give me a week and I'll have time to get my pencil real sharp . I should have some new figures from Malaysia by then .
certainly , i love waltz very much .
It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning .
It's light enough , but the handle will get too hot after cooking .
I understand you don't have a history of shipping overseas , but I am willing to pay extra for shipping .
It sounds a good idea . Let ' s go .
Ok , here is $ 50 . Oh , can you make out an invoice for me ?
It is said that greens can improve our metabolism . In addition , I want to keep fit .
Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go .
Here you are . I have just come from downtown .
The large one .
It's really of nothing .
Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
I have taken some courses in college , such as translation , business English , and so on . So I have a good mastery of both spoken and written English
That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase .
What functions does this watch have ?
Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest .
OK . I'm sure you will love what this new automatic answering system can do for your business .
Could you tell me where the dishwashing detergent is ?
Yes , May I help you ?
Hi , Mary , can I have a minute ?
Pleas turn right at the traffic lights .
Oh , is that right ? Is there a subway station near here ?
Well , I am looking for some winter clothes for my fiancee .
Oh , yes .
Thank you very much . I had a really good time .
that's good . Are you planning on immigrating to another country ?
That's a good idea . But leave the front as it is now .
You think it's better that he should be told ?
Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .
I'm very sorry about this .
I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX , LIPTON and WALLS . After making a customer survey , I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese .
That's no problem . Is it cash ?
Can you pass me the lighter ?
Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more .
A debit card will be fine .
Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment .
How did Jim get the money ?
Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option .
Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao -- the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty .
All right . Let's chat next time . Bye-bye .
I'll go take a shower .
Hopefully we won't have any more blackouts .
Oh , yes . My husband also has some laundry . This is his suit and here is his pajamas .
Yes , I do . I find it very informative . It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too .
It's nothing to get upset about .
The woman was beaten again . Why didn ' t she call the police .
I went hiking and have terrible poison oak .
I work here .
Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ?
Do you play any sports or games ?
Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight .
Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name .
Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him .
Yeah !
He ran four miles and came back dead beat .
I hope not but it will take at least three hours .
Excuse me , are these deck chairs free ?
oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ?
Isn ' t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ' s safe .
Yeah , that ' s too bad .
Possibly you are now . But in case you will change your mind , please let me know .
I see . Is it your first interview ?
That ' s all right . Bring me over what you ' Ve got .
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man !
Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale .
Julia , what do you think of the network ?
No , I went for an interview .
That ' s right .
It's true , sir .
All right , expecting you .
Where ' s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ' s the waxworks museum .
I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ?
ok . Can I ask who is calling , please ?
Sure they are .
Oh , I don't know . Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days .
Some of the ads in the paper are from people looking for roommates .
Any more ?
You should go to the dentist .
Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute .
Just make out a deposit slip and come here during bank hours . That's from 9 a . m . to 3 p . m .
I believe that two people did get hurt .
Oh , we have many kinds . Do you like this design .
Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
Well , Yes . There are something wrong actually . Perhaps you can give me some advice .
I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up .
ok . I ' ll start by looking at the motor . I ' ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ' s the problem . It ' s quite simple . I ' ll sort it out in a few minutes .
Let me see . What a moving poem !
A wise decision . If you decide to take out a short-term loan with us , say for 6 months or less , the interest rate shall be for that of a 6 - month loan .
How are you , Sam ?
wow , it that your sports car ?
Oh , my Adult College Entrance Exam is also around then . I don't know if I can pass it .
He has the flu .
What happened to you ?
Yeah . It ' s a lot better than mine .
Mr . : Please open your books to page 10 . ( To Mary ) Can I help you ?
( ha ha ) I ' ll keep that in mind , but don ' t tell my husband .
Okay Rebecca , well I think you ' Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ' s talk a little bit about your weaknesses .
Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside .
What else do you have ?
what do we need to get from the supermarket ?
I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ...
I'm really sick !
OK . But I hope it won't take too long .
I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
What subject did you minor in ?
We'll go tomorrow .
No problem . Get in now .
I just had a terrible week .
Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room .
Nervous ? Why ?
Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going .
So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ?
It's because of the view .
The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ' m sure we ' ll make it .
Yes , speaking .
This one is our cheapest .
Well , make up your mind . We need to know .
Deborah had her baby last week .
I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do .
Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ?
I often play badminton with my parents .
No , I ' d like to know something about contact lenses .
The same thing is wrong with your bumper .
The swim stations are very popular , sir . I hope you don't find a line down there .
Yes , I'd like to give it a try .
Sounds like you better buy a bicycle .
What do you charge for the sports shoes ?
I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like .
Yes , that's right . We have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already .
What state is west of Pennsylvania ?
They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap .
I never stay out that late . That's too late .
Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting !
It's easy . You only have to search the internet in order to get the information you're looking for .
What was the reason for your call ?
I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through .
No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this .
He would think you were crazy , Caroline .
How would your coworkers describe you ?
Really ? Where do you work out at ?
You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .
How nice ! But will you have to pay for the training ?
There was no reason for them to arrest me .
Do you like a job in a library , working with books ?
It is not very complicated . You can send your resume to the e-mail address of our company .
I'll try my best .
I have earned a lot of money this week , more than I do in a fortnight .
If you join us , our company will provide you a single dormitory . If you make great achievements , our company will offer you a flat according to the related regulations . It all depends .
Yes , I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other .
Yes . How long would you like us to keep it ?
He stood you up .
Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ?
People say that you never have a real winter in the South China , but I don't think so .
I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ?
They have changed the asking price since it first went on the market . It is now two hundred and twenty-five thousand .
Good Morning Mr Jones .
I see . so this is your hometown ?
When you cross the quad , the office is right in front of you . Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line .
She's pretty conservative .
When I ' m old , I ' ll also be like that .
Oh , four or five . How much is the rent for this apartment ?
My friends and I just got back from Bali .
Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !
I want to buy a bottle of perfume for myself .
Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home .
Well , I've got a huge load of typing and Mr . Brown has insisted I get it done by tomorrow afternoon . Could you help me to type half of it ?
Have you got any outdoor interests ?
What ' s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ' s really funny !
Have you ever seen coco ?
Who was he out with ?
Morning . May I help you ?
Bill , will you be free at noon ?
Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard . That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America .
Not at all . You can find most of them at supermarket . The ingredients are usually the same as in western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .
John , I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year .
I finally went out to dinner with him last night .
Here you are . Take one at a time .
Hey , Mom , look what I found !
Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist .
Can you help me ? This fitting has come loose and I need something to tighten it up .
Now , Let ' s make ourselves comfortable since we have got quiet a long way to go .
Great . I'll call you Saturday morning .
Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales .
Yes , I am looking for a skirt . What's in fashion now ?
May , is the university a terrible place ?
You have to maintain a minimum balance of $ 100 .
Well , I'm here to get some help from you . I was hoping to have someone who we can deal with exclusively . On a long-term basis , if that's possible .
Right . Cool ! Let's go !
my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him .
Nothing . Maybe it is just the weather . Rainy days often make me feel a little sad .
You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun .
Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' .
Show me your document , please .
You are late again , Maria . The teacher is about to come .
No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that .
What ' s your destination ?
Richard ? Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner ?
This is my luggage , but it's too heavy . I can't move it . Could you help me get it out of the conveyer belt ?
How fast were you going ?
Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather .
All right . Wait for a moment , please .
Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ' t bought my mom anything ! I ' m such a bad son !
That depends . What is it ?
Yeah , I ' Ve just moved here , and I ' d like to activate my cell phone , and I ' m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan .
Ah , good morning , Mr . Smith . Nice to meet you . I'm Peter Anderson from Personnel . Do sit down .
OK . Here's my account details .
How are you , Mr Wilson ? I am Tina .
It certainly is . It's so much fun .
try not to take on more than you can handle .
Fine . Would it be OK to look at the room ?
What else are you going to have ?
You're always welcome . Anything else can I do for you , sir ?
Then what time do you think he will be in ?
Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ?
seriously ? But you are such a genius .
Why would I do that ?
Thank you . I am a learner so can you tell me where I can find a ski instructor ?
We ' Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them .
They can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it .
Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ?
It's ultra-compact , it has a brushed , titanium metal body and a rubber shock-proof , weather-proof case with a belt clip .
How about Thursday ?
That's true . Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring .
So ? You can go to the class for me . Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?
92 .
which country do you want to go to ?
About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ' s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
Www !
Who will pay for these things ?
Is she your teacher ?
How many orders do we still need to pack , Gale ? We've been packing all day .
So , basically , I am OK ?
What's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ?
I'm going to listen to the radio .
Well , let's try some braised pork , sweet and sour fish and some fried beans .
I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful .
Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle .
I'll just get a Snickers then .
Then I'll have the pork cutlet instead .
Yes , and you know what ?
I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?
Rich ! I ' m glad I caught you . Mr . Carlton ' s just come over here from the main office .
That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no .
What's it like to work with her ?
I went to the cafeteria and bought it .
How about my hand carry luggage ?
That ' s why many people look up to him .
Of course , I'll get right on it .
I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply .
What is the cost ?
Does he watch a lot of movies ?
Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend .
Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest .
No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . Careful , hold it by the java jacket . This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ?
Well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he !
I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business . Another competitor is going bankrupt . That could be good news for us .
I honestly don't know .
No , I want the fish .
Here you are Mr . Lee . Will there be anything else ?
How do I set it ?
There's just going to be 6 of us tonight .
do you have internet in your room ?
Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife .
No , I don't know what that is .
I'm really sorry . I'll face the music .
Did he do something wrong ?
It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area .
We finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on to the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight .
Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ' m going to prune the hedge .
Got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
No . I hate cell phones . But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone .
Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ' s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea
Yes . But I recommend you to buy pantyhose . The stockings are already out-dated .
No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .
Great idea ! I like authentic Chinese food .
I usually shop at Sons .
Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around .
And for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount .
Really ? well , ok , you're welcome .
Yes , it is , but not as hot as in Beijing .
Are you looking for anything else ?
I'm fling , Jack . ( singing ) Come , Josephine , in my flying machine . Up she goes , and up she goes ...
Please forgive me . You have my word . I'll spend some time with you on the weekend . I promise .
Good , what about the export packing ?
I honestly don ' t know what else to tell you .
Among those collections , which is the most expensive ?
And what ' s Mrs . King doing ?
The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good .
Cool ! Anything else ?
Is it really completely flat ?
Sure , no problem . Do you happen to have the receipt ?
Yes . There are trains at seven fifty-nine , nine eighteen , ten thirty-two and eleven fifty-five .
And I need to stretch my legs now .
what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ?
But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one .
So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ?
Would you take $ 12 ?
No , what's the difference ?
In California .
How sweet ... if you make me some more toast , I'll let you use my new retro toaster ...
I'm looking for the cameras .
I will go to the bank , give them my check , show them one piece of my identifications , and the most important thing is that I should sign my name to endorse the check .
What ' s the point ? We always make a new year ' s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ' s pointless .
How are you ?
I'd like to book a room for three nights .
Sorry ma'm , the only opening we have after lunch is one fifteen , but I might be able to work you in after 4 . would that be a better time ?
OK , are you already an account holder ?
A special order of banana pancakes for you !
definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce .
Very well , I'll take these two .
What is your address , sir ?
The school is a little bit too far away . I simply want to take good care of my elderly grandfather .
I don't think so , why do you ask ?
Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ?
Yes , it's a great job . I love it . And what do you do ?
What newspaper are you reading ?
Thank you ! I lived there when I came to Beijing last time . It's comfortable and beautiful .
Nice choice .
A taxi it is . Where will you be headed ?
Mary , I've some bad news for you .
No , thanks . I'll have to meet my friend at the airport .
I ' m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ' d like to read them .
yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look .
May I have your order , please ?
I'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . What about the quality standard ?
I'd like sports , please .
Does she go to night school ?
Actually , five and a half . On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning .
I'd like to . See you then .
Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful .
What ' s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook .
I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team !
Yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak .
OK , we've finished . Can you get your father and brother ?
Did you lock the doors ?
You can give it a try ! May be you will succeed .
You really have a bid head , don't you !
You ' ll have to buy your own ticket though .
Thanks , I appreciate that !
We have decided to go to the park this Sunday . Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet ?
It's ok .
Certainly . Which flight would you like ?
I ' m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly .
Is that right ? Wonderful , wonderful . I've been in King Dao for two years now . A great place . Nice people and great beer ! Well , I guess we ' d better get started .
No , you don't . We'll take care of it .
Judge from his look , he's a very serious person .
Hello , Kate .
And they said you should play classical music ?
What a great weekend that was !
Could it be the battery ?
Fine , Mr . Richardson . What do you have in mind ?
What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ?
How is your business on the Internet , Steven ?
I really should be on my way .
Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?
well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic .
No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
Well , I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship .
Good afternoon . " ginger ' s restaurant " . May I help you ?
She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship .
To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single .
Sorry , we haven't got any . But we have a room without private bath room .
At 8 am . By the way , it also makes a refueling stop .
Could you arrange an appointment with Mr . Smith ?
About six years ...
My husband takes him in the car . He passes the school on the way to the office .
Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .
Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle .
Yes , I'm really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
After a while .
that's amazing . Are you doing well in your classes ?
Can you sing the song ?
What's wrong with you ?
To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ?
I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages .
This is your luggage check , which you must show when you disembark at your destination , and here is your boarding pass and your ticket .
Well , I guess so .
Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ' t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain .
The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ' Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service .
Nope . We just hope our employees will make profit for us .
You must like to dance , right .
Yeah it's too bad ... but actually I think I know what to do .
Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .
Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in .
Really ? It's very nice of you .
Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S .
Certainly . It has been specially treated .
I was thinking of 30 % off .
You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ?
No , thank you . I've had enough .
good afternoon . " ginger ' s restaurant " . May I help you ?
You don't like the performance , do you ?
Wonderful ! A perfect piece of bread !
No , that way is longer . There are more stop lights on that street .
It's in between the wall and the bed .
Well , I have to provide some of my information , right ?
What about a boa constrictor ?
Are you in Mrs Green ' s class ?
OK . Teach me how to play the game .
This is the East Market to Central Park bus . Where do you want to go ?
Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
I want it short .
I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ?
So where did you land ?
Good Morning , Mrs . Schmidt ! I see you're standing on your head again .
Don ' t worry . I will arrange everything .
Fine . See you on the 18th .
Well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and Americano .
I'll be worried if you stay out late .
I need help finding a new refrigerator .
Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me .
Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters .
Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday .
What time is it , Tom ?
That's right , sir . Here are your tickets . Have a nice day .

Will you need anything special for the presentation ?
How ' s your little girl , Debbie ?
All right , how about the other guests .
Is that better now ?
I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though .
I'm sure we can work something out .
Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese .
Tom , your task is to clean the blackboard .
No , not at all , Brian . This year , we ' Ve all had to cut back . I ' m hoping next year ' s going to better . I hope you can understand .

Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ' s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector .
I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can .
Ok , that would be great . Do you like modern dance ? I don't care for it .

I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?

Well , that's a start , I guess .

Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ?

They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too .

Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .
Couldn't he wait until we're finished eating ?
Come on . Put the gun down .

Me ? I prefer France .
I'll be sure to do that .

Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others .

Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it .
I know , but another pair can ' t hurt .
I am looking for some information about home stay .
Sorry , sir . Dinners are available 20 minutes , drinks are served throughout the flight .
Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best .
Did you see the car before it hit you ?
I've enjoyed conversing with you .
Well , shall we go to the hotel right now ? I've already made a reservation for you .
My family and I are going to dinner .
They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars .
Thanks a lot . You have been here for almost three weeks . How time flies !
You don't have to go to the mountains ! I stand on my head during my yoga routine every morning !
Yes . That would be fine .
Yes . Your ticket is valid for three days .
Wedding rings !
We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency .
I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale .
I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
Do you think we can get to the airport by 8
Good idea !
I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish .
Yes , I want to buy some grapes .
I ' m sorry . Todd , but Mr . Emory felt that it was going too slowly , and that it needed a fresh start . He should have told you .
Seventy-six , I think .
Well , how do you like this one ? You will stay there for 17 days .
Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know .
And must I go back to school ?
Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan .
Good idea . That might help .
I ' d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line .
No . But I often send e-mail to them . And make a call to my parents regularly .
This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business .
What ' s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help !
In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested .
Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you ? If she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . But if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her .
You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English .
yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over .
It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection .
Look at this bridge . We will soon be crossing the Thames .
Hey , let's eat out tonight .
I've given her enough time . I'm over it now .
No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .
Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
No , I won't . I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you .
As a matter of fact , you do .
Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ?
He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor .
ok . I ' ll let you know when I ' Ve sorted out my clothes .
Do I have to come back here after getting registered ?
Hi Pete , how do you know my name ?
It is the Colorado River . You can go down the river in a boat if you wish .
Can you book me a double room for February 22 ?
Yes , I'd like to report a case . Somebody broke into my house .
The government has to face a lot of social problems now .
The dishwasher broke down . I had the repair done and deducted the cost from the rent check .
Has everything been OK with you lately ?
Yes , here's your key . The bellboy will take you to your room .
Oh dear , my weight has gone up again .
What kind of personality do you think you have ?
And I represent ?
Only ten percent tax is included in the bill .
But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ' t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days .
Well , DHL is famous for its speed and reliability . It is the fastest international postal service available . The document will arrive in two or three days .
I know where that is at .
yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received
Everything's gone wrong .
No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ' s flight . Are there seats on another airline ?
That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
I had an interview with your company two weeks ago . I am calling to ask about the interview result . I hope you can give me a positive reply .
Well , first of all , it ' s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course !
The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice .
Hi Eric , this is her roommate Kathy . I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party .
Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them .
Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question ?
Oh , I'm so sorry .
Really ? Why ?
That ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?
How beautiful they are ! Thank you so much .
It's sapphire . We have only one brooch of this type . Will you try it on ?
yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things .
Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress .
Here will be OK .
Really ? Say it !
Thank you . Steven . That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad . You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing .
You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name .
Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?
I ' m pretty tired . I haven ' t been sleeping well .
It departs at 4:40 pm tomorrow and arrives in Sydney at 10:20 am . the next morning by way of Melboume .
That would take care of it , thank you .
Yes , doctor . ( The doctor examines the patient )
Thank you very much . This should only take me a few minutes .
We share the same desire . Have you seen the display of our products in the exhibition hall downstairs ?
What would you like for a drink ?
The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot .
Oh , yes , sure . Let me put it in the boot .
They really started looting ?
Didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ?
I really like the way this house looks .
Tomorrow night would work for me .
You mean the white building near the playground ?
There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook . Many people have to read the words .
Fine , thanks . And you ?
No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?
Where are you going for your holidays , Charles ?
You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv .
Really ? I like hot food . Can you make a few suggestions ?
We are faced with the problem that part of the consignment is unacceptable . We assume that damage occurred during the consignment was in your care .
You look upset . What ' s wrong ?
Really ? He looks so young .
How about this sunday ?
Here is the two dollars , will you bring me the receipt ?
Yes , simple as it is . It does work .
It looks great .
Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering . People can often find elder folks dancing , singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park .
No worries .
Thank you . It is very kind of you .
What a nice garden ! Look at these tulips !
Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight .
I don't think so . You are flattering me .
That sounds really good to me right now .
Excuse me , you look lost . Can I help you ?
How much do you spend on development every year ?
I'm afraid you can ' t .
Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ?
Of course I have . I'd like to marry a handsome man and have two children if possible .
We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me .
when did you graduate ?
I go as much as I can . I love hiking , because you can really get in touch with nature .
Name , age and date of birth , please .
But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers .
Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ?
We're going to pay by check .
Thank you honey , it means a lot to me .
Oh , I forget . Who ' s invited ?
Oh , is that all ?
Thanks for the pizza . It was delicious .
That's a good school . What do you study ?
OK . Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment .
The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate .
I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ?
That's very impressive . Which course did you like best ?
Okay . No problem .
It tastes great , but it is really dry . Is your fish all right ?
Let ' s hit the whirlpool for a bit . It ' ll help me loosen up .
That ' s not a very good idea . It ' s quite hot outside . Why don ' t you smoke outside ?
What do you want to know about me ?
My stomach's growling again !
Oh , I think I know what you're talking about .
My cigarettes .
The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason .
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be off and running .
It ' s under the couch .
The next flight is at five fifteen and there's another at six thirty .
How do I look ? I love these braids . They're fun !
Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue .
Oh , that ' s better . So you don ' t have to rush .
Can you tell me how much that'll cost ?
Good morning . What can I do for you ?
did you go to a public school or a private school ?
What is your technical title ?
that ' s pretty strict , if you ask me .
Right !
Check the mirror . How do you like it ?
Pleased to meet you , Mr . Farley .
Yes , I would like to make a reservation for May 3rd .
I like to get rid of clothes that I don ' t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition .
I'd like to check in .
Are you riding ? You have to install an anti-virus software on your computer . If not , you will be attacked by viruses , and it can lead your computer into failure .
I will call you when I find it .
Why do you like it best ?
I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel .
It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him .
not yet .
Her name is Laura , isn't it ?
I'd like to have my hair cut .
OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes .
That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper .
I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
Have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ?
Hey , sorry to be late .
I always make my salads with shredded cheese , croutons , and almonds .
Ok . Look ! It ' s just near your foot .
Yes , please . I'd like a cigarette , too . May I have one ?
Thanks a lot . My wife and I will be welcoming and looking forward to your visit .
Do you want a cup ?
Let ' s call it a day .
Would you be using English every day in this job ?
Don't worry , sir . I've never cut a customer . Shall I trim your moustache ?
I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum .
Not at all . It ' s a piece of cake .
He knows you very well .
OK . Our check-in time is after 12:00 . And see you tomorrow .
What's there to see ?
It ' s OK . It seems we have a lot in common .
Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road .
I am quite outgoing , I think .
May I take your order ?
Hello .  this is Susan .
it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift
Is this the right counter to check in for this flight ?
Don't worry . Bye .
No problem , can I get you anything else ?
That was really a nightmare !
Can I get a city map at the hotel ?
Take it easy . There is still one more week left before the exam begins . Have you prepared for it well ?
yes . In fact if you look at my resume , you can see that I was a manager before I started this job .
In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ?
I mean beautiful and heartfelt-something that will make her cry .
Oh , great , I saw a job ad outside your store . I am interested in the job advertised . I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me .
My advisor ?
Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss .
Well , let ' s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road .
How long will it take for my new apartment to be ready ?
Fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help .
Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young .
Do you have any plans for dinner tonight ?
What about Mr . White ?
No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life .
Let the men take the lead !
You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now .
Sure . What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in writing .
They must be your parents , what do they do ?
Is there a supermarket nearby ?
Of course , yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive .
Oh , right . I remember . There you are . Hope you don ' t have as many problems as I had !
Great . Talk to you then .
Yes , we do . It is an exciting moment .
I don't see them .
I do .
Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays .
I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
Oh , a cat ? Come on .
OK . Yeah ! Yeah !
I think you ' Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly .
That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing .
Well , I am sure you will .
We'd better ask dad first .
Yes . My name ' s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago .
I have it already .
When can I have my trousers if I bring it to you tomorrow ?
But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .
I don't understand why you haven't come to visit me .
I'd prefer a black one .
What size ?
Bye-bye . Welcome to come next time !
The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds .
I ' d like to , but I can ' t .
Is she American ?
Can I get the black ball in ?
We have a beautiful natural park .
Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ?
No , I will stay another day . my boss will get over it . Would you like to meet me for lunch tomorrow ?
Ok . Anything else ?
It ' s not really an occasion , it ' s more like I ' m sorry .
This is Ryan you are speaking with . What can I do for you ?
Could you please stop flipping the channels ?
Would you stay for another cup of coffee ?
Fortunately , there is a widely-spoken commercial language , namely English .
You really should stop smoking , you know .
Could I make a reservation for Flight 10 to Tokyo ?
Yes , sir . May I have your room number ?
Yes . She believes everything about him .
I don't mind really . Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory .
What else do you have to prove your English ability ?
You actually need to catch two buses .
Yes , that's the place to go to get healthier food .
Could be better .
Can I order something from the kitchen ?
I would like to check out .
That's impossible . I remember the number clearly . Isn't this 763-4565 ?
To which gate do I need to go to catch connecting flight 101 to New York City ?
So long . Have a nice weekend .
Yes , I do show your reservation . How could you like to pay for the room ?
That's true . I got the news yesterday .
Sorry , may I have your name ?
Oh , you went to the wedding ?
Please fill out the form first .
Couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? That would make things much easier for us .
True ? The food is terrible .
That shouldn't be a problem , as long as we can make ends meet .
Do you know where the local office for this area is ?
One isn ' t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers .
well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per
it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place .
I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her .
OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ?
You are going to be such an adorable father ! Tell me about this school .
I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ?
OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you !
Who was the conductor at that event ?
Atlanta Daily .
Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing .
A hundred and eighty yuan for one way . We have a counter at the airport where our representative will lead you to the car .
OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7 . 20 . Add it to the $ 36 . 00 and the total is $ 43 . 20 .
I'll check it for you ... sorry to keep you waiting . I've found it . Is this yours ?
All right . Here is the money .
I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ' s immune
What are you supposed to drink ?
Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed .
Which do you like best ?
If you insist , I can show you the brown sets . I'll have to warn you that they're very ordinary , though .
Sure , follow me .
May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law .
Hey Eve , how are you ?
Very good . You can pick up your order in one week .
Maybe we can try ' Yuanyang pot ' this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base .
There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities .
Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ?
It is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity for interview .
I'd like to book a room , please .
Drive me to Kennedy Airport , please ?
Ok , that would be great .
Yes , we are thinking of placing an order . However we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms , including mode of payment , discount and possible date of delivery .
Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine .
that sounds really interesting . Can you speak Swahili ?
What do you think of the teacher ?
I think a regular visitor's visa should suffice . With this visa , you can stay in the United States for up to 90 days .
Seven-and-a-half .
Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly .
How many and what kind ?
No doubt . Look , I'm just browsing . If I need your help , I'll let you know .
No , there isn't at the moment .
Here you are . I'd like a window seat .
No , you can give a call when you have done checking .
Small size .
We appreciate your business .
Excuse me . My bag was stolen . Will you help me ?
We're meeting with their finance director today and then with the other directors tomorrow , just to sort out some final details .
Wow ! Is it a good car ?
We cannot judge a man totally by that .
What kind of benefit package do you offer ?
I beg you pardon ? Miss who ?
I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . I'd like to buy a car for the family .
Where are you living now ?
Yes , of course . Have you got the tickets ?
What did you do last weekend ?
We charge ten cents a copy .
Plaza Hotel , good morning . Leo speaking .
Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job .
My major is Business Administration .
Hello , miss . Can you bring me something to drink ?
The completion date will be July 1st 2007 .
I need somebody to come over and fix my internet .
Hmm . Not bad . I think I look younger with shorter hair .
Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store .
No problem . Do you have any cash on you ? I don ' t think I have enough .
She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ' t want to hire her . She ' s qualified , but she doesn ' t quite fit the profile . We ' re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ' t exactly fill them with trust .
Honey , don't tell me that you want a pet dog also .
It usually takes about half an hour .
Well , cats are certainly more independent .
Thank you . See , I ' m planning to buy a car here and I ' m planning to use my time deposit here as the collateral .
I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future . I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing .
In the spring .
Is Bob home ?
Yes , the weather sure is nice today .
Now what am I supposed to do ?
Certainly . Would you like your coffee with your dinner or later ?
Everything is going great .
Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There ' s no variety in our lives .
I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week .
We have mild wines and strong liquors . Which kind do you prefer ?
Welcome to IBA . Do you need any assistance ?
I would like to get that .
I got my father ' s goat last night .
No , I thought that would be included in the rent .
Can you get a pair for me please ?
I want a space on campus .
I have lots of friends .
I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth .
No , I haven't had a chance to take the exam as I have just arrived here .
Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ?
Then he become angry with you ?
I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well .
Would you like me to leave the samples with you ?
I can't wait !
Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?
I'd like to send a fax to Shanghai .
Definitely . I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can .
No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do youknow whose watch it is ?
Just a little steak , uh ... snack ? A bowl of clam chowder ?
I graduated from Beijing University . I majored in business administration .
The good thing is you don't need to go to school .
You ' re welcome . What ' s the problem ?
Good morning ! Marquette General Hospital . Tia speaking . May I help you ?
Yes , but you have to calculate a little . You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times . So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap .
That's wonderful . Thank you .
All right . Thanks .
Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too .
Are the plumbing all right ?
Have a biscuit instead . Eat more and smoke less !
Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ?
I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do .
Use the stairs , never the elevator .
Good evening , Mary .
You look so young .
What makes is so great ?
Ugh . Another advertisement . They ' Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie .
Which leg do you want to have , right leg or left one ?
What's your permanent address ?
Cool ! I ' Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ?
What a beautiful view .
Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ?
I can ' t stay here anymore .
It sounds good . I'll try it .
I think you should make a thorough market investigation now .
Yes , but don't worry . We'll make it .
That ' s good . I ' d like to see it .
I am going to the airport , and I have to catch the 930 flight to New York .
As I said , I'd go round the world .
Really ? Thank you .
I took a part-time job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . My work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors , communicating with them , arranging their agenda , and translating several materials . I think this activity well demonstrated my ability in English . And I will be glad to take any form of English test you arrange for me to prove my ability .
Ladies , Hotel policy requires one nine of room charge as deposit .
It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence .
Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages .
I would like to buy two bottles of brandy .
Yes , I can . I have three years experience in operating computers .
Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ?
Daniel , I can't catch up with the English teacher very well .
Mr . Simpson , if you are free , how about a lunch ?
Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play .
I help out at the children ' s hospital . I help plan activities .
Thanks for your forgiving .
How much can I change 100 dollars for ?
No , Thanks . Not today .
Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ?
I see . What about the dress over there ? I would like to try it on .
You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ?
How come you think of him that way ?
It's a very popular game in America .
Okay , well it ' s always more difficult to describe them isn ' t it ?
Now we really need some part-time workers . You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm . We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm . But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job . Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here .
Shipping the goods is to be made in three equal monthly installments .
I ' ll just do it myself .
So we must get you to the hotel as soon as possible . I hope to see you refreshed and revitalized tomorrow morning , as we are going to visit the Great Wall .
OK , let's go and ask .
Do I have to pay extra ?
The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss .
Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?
Uh , actually , I've gone twice this week .
Are you okay , man ? You don ' t look very well .
Yes , and the rent includes utilities .
Yeah , she has a lot of homework .
I think I'll get some new goggles .
you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander .
How many rooms are there ?
Can't you see the notes here ?
But that still sounds expensive .
She thinks it has about twenty-five or thirty thousand miles .
Really ? You must be ...
Please accept my deep apology .
How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ?
Yes , my first marriage was a failure .
The southbound A trains say Brooklyn .
Are you all right ?
Hi Joe .
I see ! Do you want to ask her out ?
Have the aerobic classes any effect on you ?
They are very large , discount department stores . That means their prices are very good . And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom .
What are you planning on cooking ?
Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ?
Keep it . I'm buying tonight .
Lily , if you're acting sick just because you want to play hooky ...
No , I'm not .
That will be ninety-five cents in all .

I should have turned it off . I ' ll turn it off now .
Let's just say there could be some big changes around here .
Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital .
You ' ll make more money that way .
It comes to $ 40 .
That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal .
We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning .
You won ' t believe who ' s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ' Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !
Kim , have you made contact with Mr . Lee ?
First , you need a shampoo , it makes it easier for your hair to be dyed . Let's down your hair in the water , you hair will be fairly clean that way .
Oh , you have too wild of an imagination .
Noodles . How about you ?
I haven't met you at the gym for a long time .
It's my greatest pleasure to have met you . See you around .
What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ?
Yes , there are some on Pine Street .
Have you met the new girl ?
Yeah , Got a Coke ?
I'd like to very much .
It's the Automatic Teller Machine .
Don ' t touch that thermostat ! You don ' t pay the bills around here !
How about a laptop ?
Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan Hotpot restaurant for dinner !
Don ' t worry . It ' s only a cold .
Oh , really ? How does the book end ?
That ' s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too .
Have you been under a lot of pressure lately ?
I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .
Why have you stopped production ?
Hello , Rebecca , fancy meeting you here !
Would you like to travel ?
How long will you study there .
If only I could join it !
Mmm ...
You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information . What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ?
That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased .
You can ! With a little practice .
Will you be needing anything else ?
What exactly is wrong with it ?
He's my brother .
Yeah . Falling in love is so good !
Wow , it is like a maze , I think I might get lost soon .
Why are those people crying ?
It will be summer . So it will be hot .
I don't know . Maybe the same . Actually , this is my first time being in a bar .
Do you keep the receipt ?
I didn ' t see it .
I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom . We go on picnics .
I hope it will stay fine tomorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family .
Be careful . You can't smoke here .
Such as your land line phone number , mobile phone number and e-mail box .
No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor .
Come here ! I can see the tall camphor trees from here .
Would you like to have a perm ?
Working at weekend is something I hate to do most .
It's Smith . Here is my driver's license .
They sell pieces of fried chicken , you've got to try one this time .
And then I made lunch .
I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can .
So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?
I don ' t know . I didn ' t really feel like going out . I guess I ' m feeling a little homesick .
He was messing around last week in class .
hi , how are you doing ?
Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
Sure , I'll give you a call .
Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either .
I am afraid we have no extra key . So I will send somebody to your room .
As soon as possible .
Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?
Peter , listen to the lyrics of this song .
Ping . P-I-N-G .
Is this the Law Firm of A & B ?
Are meals included ?
How many plates of ice ream did you eat , young man ?
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ?
Yes , you do . The Hot Cap is back here in the corner . I think we're ready to put the curlers in . What kind of perm would you like ?
Well , if you ever need help with an extension , you can dial O .
When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you .
Actually , you do not need to go into the office to file a claim . You can do it over the phone or the Internet .
You're supposed to stand here quietly until the flag - raising ceremony is over .
I understand your position . Perhaps it ' s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ' ll feel much better with your family around .
Well , don't get bend on a ship about it .
I believe you will . I ' m very pleased with your work . Your promotion will contribute to the development of the company .
that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead
good morning !
Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon .
Granted , it ' s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ' s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ' t care less about the guests .
Sorry , Mr . Smith agenda is full today .
It is about 10 minutes walk .
I know , and I will .
Can I get a soda , please ?
You are smart . The city is really charming at night .
I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
Sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ?
What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .
You mean I have the job ?
Ok , I will remember .
Yeah , let me have a try .
We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results .
It was wonderful , but I was so tired .
Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle ?
Hi . I ' m interested in renting a one-bedroom apartment .
What ' s this form for ?
What did you do after high school ?
About 300 dozens .
How much do you have to pay for the ticket ?
Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
Yes , dad ?
you see ? You ' re becoming more decisive already !
That's what I've heard .
Ok , let ' s go through this one more time . I don ' t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
Dude , are we on the right bus ?
Yes , here they are . This is my ID card . This is my diploma . And this is my certificate for nurse qualifications .
Thanks , Mrs . Doff . Please tell him to be at the airport at three p . m .
I'd like to try some Chinese food .
Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything .
Oh , I see it . Do you have multi-vitamins ?
I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ?
Is there anything I can do for you , Mr . King ?
16 . Yours ?
Well , I ' Ve always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting .
Wow . That's wonderful .
It ' s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions .
You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ' t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries .
Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower .
I like that .
You yourself have a photo studio ?
What price range are you interested in ?
We are going to need a loan . I'm not sure what loan is suitable for us , though .
Is it really going to take that long ? Will you rush the order ?
We start at the top with our name and contact information . Make sure the information is current .
Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning .
Hi , may I speak to Ryan , please ?
I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful !
I think you should do that soon . It will help you make a decision about the school you go to .
Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ?
I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't .
Sure . Let me look over them and I ' ll bring them back this afternoon .
Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember .
Happy to see you .
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ?
I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ?
You will visit the Hyde Park , Poet's Corner , Tower of London , Fleet Street and Tower Bridge .
Oh , I thought you said Laura . Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now .
Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage .
Sorry , I can ' t .
I think that you have covered all the important points already . But if I have any questions later I will contact you .
It's gone completely .
But what are the sources of water pollution ?
You want to be beautiful , don't you ? Think about the butter and flour in ...
Oh , that ' s too bad . Why don ' t you take some aspirin ?
You ' re fine with that ?
Alright , I ' ll buy this one .
What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ?
Because it was her husband who beat her .
Oh . Yes . It is

I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long .
I want to know where this relationship is going . I ' m in love with you and I need to know ...
Sure ! My number is 626-555-1739 .
It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic .
Well , it's a bit overweight . You must pay extra for it .
Can I take a credit card for the deposit ?
Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around .
But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ?
Have you just started college ?
Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ?
How about the new bar across road ?
Here ' s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ?
It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck .
I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
Will you please pose for your picture ?
Help you in the kitchen , I don ' t feel like it .
No , I just need the sheets .
I will . Thanks for your advice .
So I can use the onboard phone during the flight ?
That'll be fine . Thanks .
Let's try it !
Excuse me , could you please take a picture for us ?
Ok , just leave it to me . I ' ll take care of it .
Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade .
I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market .
What if I exceed ?
it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say .
You can taste some before you buy it . They have food tasting at the counter .
Married whom ?
Thanks ! I'm so happy . It's like a dream come true .
It's very considerate of you to do so . Do you have any laundry today ?
What are you assigned to do ?
Really ? Are you familiar with that company ?
There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for .
Here is the copy . Do you need anything else ?
Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed .
Can I have a black one over there ?
You are such an expert on it . I don't know that .
Then we return to the hotel and come back . Will you change the appointment ?
I think I'm your lucky fellow .
How much do you need to make per year ?
That's exactly what I was thinking of .
Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic .
And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ?
I know it is quite different from Western chess .
Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck !
Not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours .
That's an attractive plan . I'll think about it .
Mrs . Smith , you are always worried about your children .
When did the pipe start leaking ?
Be prepared to provide your employer ' s name and address and what dates you worked .
Welcome . Can I help you with anything ?
fine . How are your term papers ?
Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ' t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be
That ' s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500

So Alex , you ' re off to the Olympic stadium then ?
Yes , I've got all that here .
I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
Yes . There are several data documents about this contract . Please advise me which one I should give up .
That would be weird .
I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place .
Yeah . I need to get some stuff .
How about interviews ? Have you been on any of those yet ?
Not really , but I've got used to it now .
Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental , please ? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office .
Ye , I hope so . well . Take it easy .
Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here .

This way please . We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers .
No problem . Let's check the terms of contract .
I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team .
Is the driving test difficult ?
Can I get you any dessert ?
By the way , I would like some chilli oil .
Don't worry . I won't .
What did you exactly do there ?
I'd like to buy a tie to match this suit .
Yeah . I hate spending all day in there , too .
Yes , I'd like to move to another room .
Excuse me ? I didn't hear what you said .
Good morning , Felix Wasserman Associates . Beth Jennings speaking .
You went out on a date last night , didn't you ?
I didn ' t think about it that way .
Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ?
I am pretty sure how to use it , but can you remind me ?
Just make sure children don ' t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .
Well . We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia .
Take the number 5 train and get off at the United Squire .
why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue .
Where is it ?
What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ' m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday .
I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .
Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?
Yes , what kinds of wine do you have ?
Sorry , I didn ' t prepare this .
But you should make up your mind first .
I ' m afraid I can ' t , but I'd be glad to learn .
No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it .
Just about . It should be done in the next couple of days . Why ?
So , so you're British , do you missing them ?
Do you go to the cinema a lot ?
I can see five other guys eying her up .
You're kidding !
Hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage !
I can see that . But I didn ' t know you had experience in that line of work .
You must weigh that as well .
That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families .
Excuse me , would you tell me who that girl is ?
No , don ' t bother . It ' s all right as it is .
But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs .
I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see .
You will be busier , right ?
I heard that we will call at some ports on the way . Is that true ?
Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ?
Of course , I'm sure you will like it .
They are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work .
I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ?
I would like to buy a new fridge .
She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces .
Hi , Brad . How are you today ?
Do you have a problem walking a little bit ?
do you have any plans for Friday night ?
Well , I know how to turn it off !
I hope that I get what I asked for .
I'd like to buy a house about 300m with a garden . Can you help me ?
So there are only five working days in a week ?
That ' s exactly what I ' m getting at . We ' re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out .
Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ?
All right . There we go .
Yeah , but I don't know if it is going to be any good .

I see . That's what I thought .
That will be a tough match , right ?
Yes . The baked fish was out of this world .
I ' m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ' m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ' m amazed that I haven ' t even won a small prize yet . It ' s so unfair !
May I have a word with you ?
Don ' t worry . I know there are no pennies from heaven . I will work hard .
I just cann't believe my ears !
Ahhhhhhhh
I ' ll pick you up at ... say , seven thirty ?
I ' m sorry , Mr . Michael . Could you tell me where the problems are exactly ? Maybe I misunderstood the client ' s intentions .
Take the magazines out of the bookcase . Put them in that box .
Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ?

I see . Where are you now , Li ?
But don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and walk back . It's not far .

Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ' d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results .
How about rose ? It's the most suitable one for lovers .
Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible .
No , doctor . I never have enough time for exercise . I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening . Then I can't get to sleep . Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep ?
I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane .
Begin at 9 o ' clock sharp .
Thank you , I ' ll pay next then .
I am just reminding you about the time . You don't want to miss the plane , do you ?

It ' s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now .
Mr . Johnson , for the unguaranteed reservation , we can only hold the room by 6 p . m . , because it is the peak season now . If you make a guaranteed reservation , we can hold the room overnight . Would you like to make a guaranteed reservation by credit card ?

I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend .
Yes . I want a first class single ticket .
Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We've sightly overspent this month .

OK . Would you like something to drink in advance ? We have all kinds of sodas , juices , beers and wines .
Ouch . You must be very disappointed .

It is a way to make a living , but beyond this it's a way of fulfilling one's development . It can prove your ability .

You have to pay a fine .
I think that you are right . Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something .
Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it .
Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ?
Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip .
Well , only you liked it really , darling .
How's your new job going ?
I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ?
Oh , as simple as that ! I shall never wait for a real person again , these machines are wonderful .
It only takes about half an hour .
And the height ?
Probably not .
Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
Thanks . It was very nice to meet you .
Too many . I will just give you one example , Huangguoshu Falls , the largest waler-fall in China .
I'm so glad to meet you .
I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow .
I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house .
$ 850 a month is not enough money .
Would you please bring me the black suit ? I want to try it on .
Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible
Sure . First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library .
Ok , thank you .
I will need you to face this glass plate right over here .
Finally !
Of course . That's what we deserve .
You'll find that by the paper towels .
So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday .
Hi , Gerry . How can I help you ?
Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important . We want our students to take the class as soon as they can . And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher .
I'm sure you will have fun no matter where you go . Remember to take your bag .
What do you know about our company ?
Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ' t like your way .
Do you know where you're going to get it ?
Thanks for all your help .
Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines .
That ' s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ' Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !
Some grape juice would also be nice .
She a as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ?
Can you tell me why you like it ?
Why don't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ?
Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ?
Okay , you call them .
Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space . But I also think interpersonal skills very important . Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time .
Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle .
Ever hear of WebTracker ?
Very good . Now can you tell me the hours of operation ?
Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works !
Yes , but he ' s got a wife and 3 children as well .
Could I have your name and room number ?
Poor girl !
There is a wait right now to use the computers .
I'm always feeling hungry .
If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes .
Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ?
It seems that the inner beauty is also important .
Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well .
that will be all . You're been very helpful , thanks .
Just to the bottom of my ears . By the way , I'd like a shave , too .
Can you think of some other places where I may look for work ?
Sorry I couldn't help you .
But she did and it made me disappointed .
It would have to be after lunch . Do you have anything available about 2 o'clock ?
How much is a regular haircut without shampoo ?
How long do I have to wait ?
Yep ! The nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . Some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here .
Why use wooden cases ?
Let me know if you do need anything .
You know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness .
Yeah , I do . I guess I'm a real fitness freak .
Would you trim off a bit there , about the ear .
What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ?
Mr . : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students .
He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him !
That's true . Ok , I will think about it .
Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home .
Thanks for reminding me . It always slips my mind .
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ?
How could you have done that without asking me first ?
Well , our store offers a 90 - Day return policy and the manufacturer offers a one-year warranty on any factory defects .
It sure is hot . Why don't we go in the Haunted House ? At least it will be air conditioned .
I know that's what I must do .
Well , haven't you heard ?
I made a doctor's appointment for you .
Actually , yes . Could you show me how to use my key card ?
No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax .
I just lost my job . My boss just told me .
What's the hurry ?
how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ?
Excuse me . Does this bus go by Tiananmen square ?
Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends .
Don't you see I'm trying my best ?
Sorry , sir . We receive credit card and cash only .
Brad Bush ? Good for you !
That ' s one of the conditions of my police too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire .
Do you need it for the whole weekend ?
Sure . If I could , I would eat hotpot every day !
Okay ... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! And what about some appetizers ?
I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !
Do you have deviled crabs ?
No . Um , do you carry any padded coat ?
We should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air .
Good day to you . How can we assist you today ?
Actually , I haven ' t had time to look it over . Did you bring another copy with you ?
His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried .
Are there any clear answers in the book to this question ?
Well , I know you ' re pretty booked up these days . But , we ' Ve got to work fast on this .
Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ?
Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often .
Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ...
No , I've already been to here for three interviews .
Yes , what can I do for you ?
We can get started as soon as you fill out this form .
Hello
Where do we begin ?
It has fifty parking spaces .
Is there the correct billing address ?
come on ! We're traveling on our own . It won't cost too much .
You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well .
Hello , is this the ABC Company ?
Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly .
You're right . I will have a talk to her about that .
I think that we should check out the kitchen . It is listed as roomy and spacious .
I sure did !
Maybe you should ask him openly .
I know , you should really go and see her and the baby .
That ' s fine . I appreciate your help .
My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor .
Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?
Okay , how about a midnight curfew ? And I'll let you know where I am .
Because you ' d end up spoiled rotten if I wasn ' t .
Look what you did to my rear bumper .
Huh ? Me ?
You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him .
Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees .
Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen .
You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ?
The only way you're eating tonight is if you cook .
Loans Department , how can I help you ?
That ' s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ' ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ' t be able to change him .
I don ' t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one .
They're in Aisle Two .
I'm sorry . All the back of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ?
That's great . Anything else ?
Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don't like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous-I can't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished .
How so you want to your hair cut ? Any particular way ?
500 feet ! I would never be able to do that .
One dollar to five franc . Is that alright ?
That's a secret . Here , let me help you with your coat , and we'll be on our way .
Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ?
What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
Where is the next taxi stand ?
Send it by the fastest way .
absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history !
Do you have any other special skills ?
that's annoying , but nothing to worry about .
Are there many side effects ?
Here ' s my card , just give me a call if you ' re interested .
Does the TV have cable ?
But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ?
The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English .
You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar .
And these old Dutch candle holders would go nicely with the tea set . Have them .
I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
Hi , Alex . How are you doing ?
It's so busy here .
I don ' t know . Never saw him before . Why ?
Ok , I ' m going to stay up awhile . I ' Ve got to go over the household budget , We ' re a little over-spend this month .
I ' m sure that he will .
I want to go all out if we can afford it .
I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks .
I really wasn't told anything .
I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work .
Did you move into your new apartment ?
I want to find an old music box .
Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . Make it hot , please .
I ' m going to need my deposit back .
Yes , the deadline for applying is 1st Feb , so I hope they will arrive in 3 days .
Hum , what you say make sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age .
when is the first meeting then ?
I work there every year .
My fees went up , but I didn ' t even know I had fees to pay .
Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come .
There is a library right inside the front door .
Great , then let's go visit him . I want to give him some flowers , too , to say sorry .
Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that . If you are sure , we can go ahead now , Sir . How does 10 am tomorrow sound , to get all of the paperwork out of the way ?
$ 80 .
Left at the lights ?
Oh , very good .
Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ?
If you have any more laundry , please just leave it in the laundry bag behind the bathroom door . The laundryman comes to collect it every morning .
Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags .
Three of our friends will join us so can you seat 5 people at that time ?
And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ?
There ' s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow .
Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message .
yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company .
My name is Mona White .
What is the hourly rate for a car like this ?
That'll be nonsmoking . Now , do you approve of a single queen-size bed ?
are they window seats or aisle seats ?
Sure . Kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment .
How am I going to get home ?
I know , Grandma , I just ...
Hey , come on . It ' s too early to say that . We can fix things .
I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate . So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ?
Come on . Two is company .
Sure . We have to have something to lie on while we're catching some rays .
When did you go there ?
Not quite , Sir . We will need to also know the account number , the deposited amount and your PIN number . You will also have to come in and fill out some forms .
What store are you going to ?
How do you do . I ' m Mark Rancor .
I do hope this undesirable incident will not stand in the way of our future business .
Oh , that sounds great !
Wonderful , I will give you a chance of interview .
I'm sorry to hear that . Please tell me the exact problem .
2,000 RIB per month .
Excuse me . Have you got the time ?
yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
It leaves in 20 minutes .
Hello , Mr . Liang . I've done with the work . My report is here so please give me new instructions .
RIB . By the way , what is the exchange rate today ?
10 pence off if you use this coupon .
I'm not sure . Could you measure me , please ?
Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue !
Sure , I used to work there . Go straight for about a mile , then turn left at the light . The mall will be on the right .
It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .
Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .
I have a collect call for you from Jennifer . Will you accept the charges ?
Chen Hong , too .
He told me to stay in bed for ten days .
You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7 .
Perhaps because of the dirty air .
Have a good day !
I didn ' t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference .
My appointment was on Tuesday .
Can you give us an example ?
I see , sir . Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago .
They're all so thin ! Her cheekbones are great .
I don't know exactly .
In that case , you ' d better have it registered .
good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ?
Okay , that's clear enough . Let's move on to the other terms .
He just stepped out . Can I take a message ?
I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
Haven ' t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager .
More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry .
Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ?
It's about two days .
How's he doing ?
I see ! How many pieces of cake did you eat ?
Ok ... I ' ll talk to you later . Bye
Or else I'll get into trouble .
I don't know how to do it .
Oh dear . I don't have it with me . Do you take debit cards or should I pay with cash ?
Unfortunately , it doesn't . However we can give you a 10 % discount on the frame . We also offer a very good financing plan . There is no payment no interest until next June .
At school , in China . This is my first time to be out of my own country .
Richard , why didn't you come to school today ?
What college are you attending ?
Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works .
I really don't know , but I don't think she gave out that many yet .
Oh , I'm sorry . Let me go back to the cashier's to have it changed . ( a few minutes later , the waiter returns with the new bill . )
Sign here , PLS . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . This slip has all the information you need . Pls drive safely , sir .
I think so . You can get anywhere by bus and taxi is not expensive .
Ah , ah , ah ...
Well . Thank you for coming .
I mean very short , shorter than it is now .
Did you bring some lunch with you ?
That guy's manner really turns me off .
Oh , my God ! What's this ?
That would be wonderful . Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes independently . Would that be OK ?
Yes , I ' Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ' s my idol .
Sorry . What was that you said ?
Can we have the bill now ?
I don't want to do the damn dishes .
They're blue .
It's just about ten minutes ' walk . Go along this street , on the third cross you'll find it on your left .
I like it very much .
Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance . He will pay you for them . Are you going today ?
Yes , they do . It's great for them to tie the knot and get married .
I will poke your eyes out .
Yes , I understand .
Really , Mary , you ' re horrible .
All right , I'll let you know when I get through .
You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ' m between a rock and a hard place .
Till I moved out of my parents ' home , I became a lot more independent .
I'll beat him .
Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet .
I ' Ve just taken out an insurance policy . Are you insured ?
We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning .
Err , well , I can ' t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon .
Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are !
I know . What time do they go ?
You means she didn ' t marry a rich man .
Excuse me , sir , the toilet in my room doesn't flush .
I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here .
The cement arrived late but don't worry , I'm confident we can still meet the deadline . The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again .
You're right . Thank you for the advice .
Open the book and turn to page 10 .
That is good news .
You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be !
While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove .
I ' m forming a music band .
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
Good , morning ! Can I help you ?
You can knock off another 2 % for that .
City Bank . This is Tom . May I help you ?
Why do you think so ?
I am going to the beech . How about coming with me ?
Would you like to have them altered ? Or would you like a different size ?
all right . But I think you ought to move soon .
That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way .
Sure thing .
Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ?
It depends on how you want to travel . If you want a soft sleeper , it will cost 610 RIB , if you want a hard seat , it will only cost 100RMB .
Well , that was an interesting documentary !
You two are always quarrelling over little things .
Tell me the news .
Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner .
Have you made a reservation ladies ?
Great , let ' s go !
I think 250 dollars should be sufficient .
My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year .
What can I do for you , Miss ?
Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week .
Yes . Don ' t you ?
I will bring the diary .
Is this taxi taken ?
I ' m glad you finally agree .
Is she really ? I can ' t believe it !
Daddy , I am so glad you come out with us .
But she can ' t be home now . She might have gone to the library .
For how much ?
Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month .
When did you arrive here ?
Hey , young man , you are so deep today .
Good idea . Let's goa
Yes . please .
I'm OK . I promise . Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time .
I guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable .
No , most of the traditional festivals of the minority nationalities are not official .
Easy . I could do that with my eyes closed . ( after a while ) Done .
I have a better idea . Let's go to a jazz concert and I'll give you an education in jazz .
This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable I think could fall asleep !
Shall we have a game together some day ?
Will you give me a hand , sir ?
really ? Who do you chat with ?
I hope nothing is wrong .
Yes , I ' Ve finished .
So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ?
Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ' clock ?
I like spring .
Will , I'm under a lot of pressure . My manager is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them .
Well , let me know if there ' s anything I can do to help out .
May I carry this satchel ?
Have you gone out on any interviews so far ?
Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ?
I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ?
My pen name is ' Dark Blue ' .
Yeah , sure .
I have many hobbies , I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to pop songs .
I can handle that . I can operate word - processor , fax machine , photostat , and other office equipments .
Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together .
Six tens will be fine .
What are we going to eat for dinner ?
All right . Shall I check the oil ?
I can't believe that .
What would you like for dessert ?
How long have you been having this problem ?
It's not too salty .
Have you got anything a bit cheaper ?
Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars .
We export to Eastern Europe and the Far East . The domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales .
What should I avoid ?
Alright . See ya !
I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? '
Can I have a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare ?
That's a lot of money ! What did you do ? Break the piggy bank ?
I just don't like my hair .
Sorry , I'm late .
That's 886 .
After you ' Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we ' ll add some spices to flavor it .
Yeah . I really like the stores and the shopping .
OK , I'll go check it out .
Your luggage is two pounds over , I am afraid there'll be an excess luggage charge , sir .
No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint .
We need to talk .
I see . What a pity . I have to appreciate it carefully .
I'd like to return this radio .
I'm in the car business .
Thank God , we haven't encountered a burglar . I hope that our house is secure against burglary .
Will you forgive me . Could you return my camera ?
He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class .
What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
Las Vegas is in the southwest .
I'm knee-deep in cockroaches !
I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time .
Isn ' t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race .
55 dollars , madam .
In a word , cockroaches !
Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything . Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff . It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them .
Perhaps you could look again , sir , to double-check .
Don't mention it . I am pleased to help you .
Well , don ' t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen .
Thank you very much sir .
Yes , it will print immediately .
Oh ! yes
I would like to check out a book .
You won't need it . Tom is going to treat everybody !
all cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up .
Which charges are you talking about ?
yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa .
Yes , they're ready to go .
Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long .
It's ten cents a copy , sir .
Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ?
I want to go back to school .
Hey ! Fred , you are five minutes earlier than me today . Usually , you don't .
I ' Ve changed my mind .
You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ?
I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room .
Let ' s see . Do you want to go to a bar and sing some karaoke ?
It's in the eyes . They're the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy .
Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August .
Would you please help me with my luggage ?
Aright . I'll talk to you later .
Boy oh , boy ! This is so cool . Let's rock and roll !
There ' s a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall .
Yes , there is one at Sanyuan Bridge . It is a famous restaurant in the city .
really ? I'll take it , and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ?
No problem . How would like your money ?
Fine ! I'll be back by nine then . Don't worry .
I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow .
I've heard about it , but never had one .
But each children has his own interest .
But what about the indirect ones ?
I ' m sorry . It ' s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ' re welcome to look through it .
Why do you want to teach at our school ?
Please let me know when you go to China and let me be of some assistance to you .
If you refuse to take risk , you can ' t have better returns .
True , and I like the kitchen . It's new and well equipped .
Are you nuts ! I ' m not going to run a red light !
So would you say if things don ' t go your way at work it could easily get you down ?
Hi , excuse me , Sir ? I ' m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ' Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ' t provide any support anymore .
Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ?
Yes . After that you should emphasize your skills , educational background and related experience .
What are you doing this weekend ?
My name is Sam .
Sure , here you are . And here are my application forms as well .
How much is a stamp to send a letter to France , please ?
We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ?
Mike ! Look at the floor !
We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill .
I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ?
I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ...
I want to draw some money from my current account .
Martin .
I actually found it in the ads , and it ' s not too expensive either .
How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
Now I see what you read the book for . But it's fine . I'll give you the lion's share .
Yes , and I think I have good news for you .
Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag .
After you
Sounds good .

What kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?
Firstly , we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes . And then on the day when he is coming , we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate .

I am not sure . But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour .

Is that satisfactory ?
I don ' t know . I think it ' s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example .

I don ' t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly .

What kind of music do you like ?
Oh , thank you . Thank you very much .

I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave .
OK , OK . Enough already . We'd better hustle . The contest starts in five minutes .
Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things .
Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through .
I see . Please prepare my bill and I will be right down to pay it .
OK ! See you later !

Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ?
They look all right to me .
Rather difficult . How about you ?
If I tell you who did , will you release me ?
I ' d like to . But Bob , are you sure it will be all right ? I would hate you to make your boss angry or even lose your job .

Mike , I'm afraid I can't come back home for dinner tonight .

I'll have a double whiskey on the rocks .

And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain .
Neither have I .
I don't want people to think I'm stingy .

If there's anything that I can help you in the future , please let me know .
I mailed in an absentee ballot .

I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ?
If I put you in at a later spot , would that work out ?

But their love is touching !
Yes , I have a list of extensions .
How can I help you ?
I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ' s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ?

The sea is calm and peaceful . A sea trip is always enjoyable in fine weather like this .

Just follow the foot movements . Brush left , brush right ... yeah ! That's it !

OK ! Then what can I do after I finish it ?
Oh yeah ! I saw a review of that restaurant on television . The reviewer loved it !
Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation . But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars . Even in our movies cars are very important .

You are speaking with Ryan . How can I help you ?
What kind of chocolate ?
There will be 4 of us .
Of course . What would you like ?
Then when will you be back again ?
Is it raining right now ?
I would like to take my two weeks vacation time .
Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays .
ok . Mmm .
let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?
I feel nervous when I face Nova .
They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon .
Fine , but first I need some information about you .
That ' s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids .
And now ?
I want to meet you . Are you free this evening ?
No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that .
We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March .
Nice day , isn't it ?
About two years , but it seems as if I got here yesterday .
Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
Wonderful ! You know what ? I wish you wanted to relax everyday .
In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
I need to look for a new bedroom set .

Because I want to change my working environment and seek new challenges .
What ? Really ? I don ' t really want to have to buy a new phone .
Our special tonight is lobster .
I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown .
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?
Certainly sir .
How amazing !
It's very kind of you .
It ' s great . Although his father didn ' t agree with that , Tom went through with it .
What date would you check in , Ma ' am ?
I don ' t think he ' s back today .
Oh , you poor thing !
She is quite young and her hair is blond .
Sorry , I overslept . My alarm clock didn't go off this morning .
Hello , Is this EYE computers ?
Have you bought your bus pass yet ?
I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway .
They ' re really running you into the ground . Why don ' t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .
Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum !
There's a question I'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask .
One dollar .
Miss Sun , could you please type this report for me ?
So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan .

A hundred and fifty . No , wait , make that a hundred and sixty .
Have you heard about Jessica's party on Saturday ?
... Okay , I'm done . Here's the form and my old card .
You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know .
Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar .
I'm afraid I haven't got one in your size .
I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ?
Ok , let ' s start opening some presents !
There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ?
Good .
I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me .
Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .
You can always make an easy breakfast .
On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems .
It will be held at the Central Music Hall .
Anything you say , Madam .
It is great . But Tom's bike is so much better than mine .
The service wasn't that great , either .
Now I remember . We met at a conference in Tokyo last year .
Yeah , thank you for telling me .
I ' d just like to trim . Don ' t cut too short .
Yes . All the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy .
Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ?

You can't give me a break ?
I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation .
Yes , but we can ' t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings .
That restaurant has six parking spaces .
Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ?
No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well .
It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient .
I can't believe it !
I'm going to Ireland this summer .
Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern .
Nope , lost again . But , it was a good game .
Fine , sir . We can accommodate you .
Good morning , Ms Chan . What can I get you today ?

I'm not cooking dinner .
So that's £ 14 . 15 for me and £ 16 . 50 for you .
Is flight ZW203 a direct one ?
What do you think of your teacher ?
Many thanks .
This is your table .
I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ...
Hello , Sunshine Travel Agency .
Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ?
Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ?
That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments .
Yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys .
When I went up there , it wasn't full at all .
I ' m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office .
I think with International Business a language would be appropriate .
Exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it .
OK . Great idea !
Can you make it on Tuesday ?
Thank you . Here ' s your change and receipt .
Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman .

Thanks . Would you like to have one more slice ?
To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars , the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars .
Can I give you a lift home , Mrs . Word ?
But the parking might be .
I ' m upset , too .
I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down .
How do you like it ?
Charles , do you have any children ?
Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to .
That's exactly what I want . How much does it charge ?
I know this characteristic of him . So I never think seriously of his words .
Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility .
Johnny , are you just sitting around again ?
Hectic . It's always hectic . But how was your windsurfing ?
And when are they coming to visit us ?
You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price .
Would you like rice with your meal ?
Has anything been upsetting you lately ?

What are you going to do to it ?
I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ?

We look for companies with a good track record . We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well , we put them on our approved list . It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with .
Well , I want to draw out 4,000 yuan .
I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?

Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous .
When would you like to fly ?

I ' m sorry , Sam . I don ' t want to foc-concert .
Welcome to the electronic age ! I can run you through it ; it's what I'm here for .
Which kind would you like ? We have five different varieties of facials .
I need to get ground beef .

I know . I was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her .
Thanks . I will ask him .
Hello . Can I help you , ma'am ?
well , what's the problem then ?
I couldn't make it .
I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect .
How much money are you making a month ?
That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you .
Really ? I ' m so sorry I bothered you . I ' ll try again .
I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received .
How would you like your hair cut , sir ?

No problem . No matter what ' s wrong with it , I can surely meet your satisfaction .
I thought he was maybe gay , but I wasn't sure . Anyhow , you don't expect me to go into a gay bar , do you ?
What a pity . Can you recommend a nice restaurant near here ?
Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious .
Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding .
I ' m definitely taking them to court .
You're right . Would you please show me some embroidery ? I also want to buy some embroidered tablecloths to match the tapestry .
I know what you mean , there wasn't old action movie next . I think you won't like it .
Why did you call me ?
Welcome to our company , My name is Jon Dahl Green . I'm in charge of the export department . Let me give you my business card .
Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago .
The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes !
Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
A well-learned person never does that .
Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability .
Hello ? Is the real Taylor in there ?
Yup , that ' s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless .
Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails .
Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ?
I agree with you . But now we have to wait . The sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . I fear a thunder storm is brewing .
Hopeful ! Thank you .
I ... I ...

Sure , Brian . What ' s on your mind ?
Thank you very much . If your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract .

I don't think they sell Kit Kats .
Well , good-bye and have a good trip !
Only 2 dollars and 25 cents .
Well , thank you very much .
What did you say ?
Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched .
You did spend too much , and most of the expense was kind of unnecessary .
Alright . With shipping charges , your total will be 68 dollars . Will you be paying with credit ?
Oh dear . That ' s terrible . What was in your wallet ?
No . I am Canadian . Are you Chinese ?
I think you ' ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ' d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines .
I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together .
I couldn ' t careless .
Cut it out . Look at my smile , and it seems like the flowers in the spring . Right ?
That is expensive .
That ' s wonderful . Thank you .

I'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
I chose the Institute of Foreign Language .
Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
I would know if I bought something that expensive .
What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
Yes , I see . I'll take it . Here ' s $ 200 .
Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty .
Go easy . Overwork is bad for your health .
poor you . It seems we are in the same boat .
Your ID card , please .
I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ' s still a millionaire .
Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country .
What is your return policy just in case he doesn't like them ?
That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem .
I see . What job did you have in mind .
Well , it's our fault . We are sorry for that . Would you please fill out the form ? We will pay for you .
You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street .
Can I see the rainbow ?

And how much for haircut with shampoo ?
Please fill out the form .
Wow , is that your sports car ?
Did I do something wrong ?
In a 40 mph zone , I was only going about 35 .
Well , it all looks so good . How about ordering the steamed prawns ?
Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate !
Uh huh . How about a used car ? They've got good ones now .
When does it arrive ?
I'll get you for that comments , George .
No , I didn ' t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added .
I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save . When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .
You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering .
What time exactly ?
No , he's still sleeping .
How do I get there on foot ?
Would you tell me the nature of the problem , sir ?
This is the White Rose Restaurant . May I help you ?

Have you got a single room for Monday evening , please ?
All right . Let's call it quits and go home .

I should take the taller one for the choice .
Anything valuable in it ?
Really ? How do you know that ?
I'm throwing a party on Friday .
then what ? Your plane was three hours late !
Why ? He did something wrong .
Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ?
my computer just crashed again for the third time today !
I ' ll have the leg of lamb .
I'm not on a diet though .
All right , we'll take it .
I'm happy to hear that , sir . Your reservation is all set except for your phone number .
Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ?
You mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters !
Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday .
It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it .
Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ?
That's too bad . Can I take another train ?
Good morning ! Is Mr . Smith in ? I'm Cheng Jun from China National Petroleum Corporation . I'd like to see him .
It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance .
Nice ! So , where did you guys go ?
I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich .
Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?
Let me run through a couple of other options with you . That way , you can make a more informed decision .
I have a headache . Is there anything I can buy without a prescription ?
I've really been working a lot lately .
Okay . I have canceled your reservation , Mr . Smith .

Do I need to pay to use it ?
Sure . That would be great . Good luck .
Would you like some drinks ?

It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having .
I love it when the weather is like this . Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow .
I agree . That ' s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin .
Shall I light the stove ?
How did you do that ?
Well , don ' t be late . I ' ll see you on Friday at Helen ' s .
You must know you've been scheduled to have an operation the day after
Let me see . Oh , you're at the wrong gate . Your plane leaves from Gate No . 8 .

This is a very good meeting , Liz .
Do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep ?

oh , we ' d like the buffet please . We ' Ve heard it ' s very good .
That's good . When can I go to see the house ?
Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem .
I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream .
Sally , I ' m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ' s Sichuan cooking .
I've been thinking of taking I've been thinking of taking a Crazy English course . Do you think it's a good idea
Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths !
Good morning . Thank you .
Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ?
When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ' t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ' s more , I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it .
Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can feel it .
How long do you want to sign a contract for ?
I will have sole then .
Does five thirty work for you ?
I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm . it was pouring with rain all afternoon .
How beautiful the detached house is !
I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ?
I didn't know you knew Frank .
nothing particular .
how about the rice ?
Fine . I have your letter and I've made some notes .
Turn right at the second traffic light and you will see it on your left .
Would you mind if I use your tape-recorder ?
Yes , that's fine . I'll take it . Can I pay by check ?
I think he won't remember White Day .
Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores .
Sorry . I take that back . I mean the copper Buddha you wanted .
We guarantee our product for two years .
I have both , but I usually use my car to get to school .
Here's the money . And get some salt .
I try to do that , but I can ' t get up early enough .
It must be a unique experience . I ' m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
What about the expression goodbye ? Is that an idiom ?
What do you need me to do ?
Now may I check this book out ?
Where are you ?
I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone .
Do we have the same classes today ?
I'd like to , but I've got to write a term paper . It will be due by this Thursday .
Yes , I did . I send most of them a week ago . I ' Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person .
Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ?
Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy .
Right . Just take off your jacket and shirt . And lie down on that bed over there ... That's right ... Now , just hold up your right arm , will you ? ... Does this hurt ?
Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field .
And people are honest ?
I have a special party tonight , and I'd like to change my style . Actually , I ' m thinking about a perm . My sister is getting married next month . I think that if I have a perm now , I'll look very natural by then . What do you say ?
They ' re not all right . They ' re uncomfortable and they look terrible .
Is there any service charge ?
I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners .
Enjoy your food ! Bye !
I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude !
I see . You are one of my favourite customers , Mr Brown . I'm more than happy to help . For Comprehensive Credit Granting , IBA will grant a promised quota for you , that is , if you qualify . Of course , your credit record , within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch .
Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected .
You also need to prepare formal clothes for the interview ; a suit should be the best .
I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening . My wife is terribly ill .
Thanks a lot
Do you often suffer from backache ?
That'd be very helpful . An extra weekend is all they really need . Thanks .
Yes , she is . By the way , what is the best season in Beijing ?
Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal . So I have to find something halfway between .
Good morning , Mary .
I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm .
All right , I see . Why do you want to work for a Sino-American joint venture enterprise now ?
Yes , but I am on holidays this week .
Do they have any grandchildren ?
Sure . Does she know your friend ?
One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for .
Yes , I did . I lost it . It disappeared .
Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge .
Yep . And relive those good old high school days .

There were several rooms , but the worst leak was in the bathroom .
Well , I've never heard of a little girl that didn't love Barbie dolls .
Open your mouth and say ah ... God , you are suffering from the swelling of tonsils .
Don ' t get me wrong ! It ' s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !
This is the first floor . The second floor is one level up .
Because General , his dog , got sick .
Yeah . Oh well , how about a game of cards instead ?
Well , I ' d like to have my coat to order . Will you take my measurements ?
A little expensive . But I'll buy it anyway . It's hard for me to get a perfect one . Here is 200 Yuan .
Is there anything wrong ?
Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others .
2 should be enough , for each one has at least 30 seats . There will be some seats to spare .
What will the girls do ?
Go down this road and then turn left .
Maybe you should .
Where did you get assigned to go this time around ?
I'm sorry to hear that . Why do you think so ?
Yes . That's why I like the house .

Oh , Mike . How are you doing ?
I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ?
Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down .
I really don ' t know that much about putting together a resume .
Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training ?
Where did you go yesterday ?
Did you enjoy your dinner ?
Well , you ' re in the right store . If they don ' t have it , no one will .
Sure . I ' Ve never seen a dragon boat race .

I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !
I go to Sons for my groceries .
Well , what about violet ? It means the eternal beauty .
Yes ?
Certainly , it's a pleasure .
No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance .
My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her .
Get new friends .
I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me .
That's right . I thought I'd give it a shot .
Do you get much rain during the summer ?
Yes , sir . Can I help you ?
What are you talking about ? We had a great time . We laughed and talked all night last time .
cool .
lt sounds like the story of my life .
I hear a noise and feel vibrations when step on the brake .
Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time .
That is OK . We have photo taking service here . You may pay your fee , take a photo there and take it back here .
O . K . , so it ' s this one ?
Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased .
You seem to like her very much , don't you ?
I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you .
OK . Please hold on a minute . So you checked in on Monday and stayed 3 nights in single room 1005 . Is that right ?
Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything .
I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with other people .
I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ?
What's the minimum deposit for opening a current account ?
I think your background and experience are worth the compensation .
It's my pleasure . How many copies would you want ?
sounds good ! Let's go !
Moderate exercise is really important for health . ' Life lies in movement . '
Here's a twenty .
Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well .
This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere .

Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company .
Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it .
I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks .
I am not surprised , you eat too much .
Oh , do you really like it ?
It doesn't matter . This one is fine .
Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried . What ' s on your mind ?
Is there anything else that doesn't cost as much ?
Sure . Take a seat , please . What would you like to know ?
Would you recommend some places for sightseeing ?
... Okay , that's it . Here's the form , and here's my old card to use as a model .
We have tons of furniture . What we need are air conditioners .
Three twenty-five cent stamps , please .
Well , the starting salary for a clerk in our company is 2,500 yuan monthly and after three months he would get a raise if his work is satisfactory .
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day .
Yes . I got very excited .
most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
Don't give me that . If you're hungry , then cook dinner .
No . A Walk in the Woods .

I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better .
But some classmates said you took the money .
Of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me .
No -- That ' s all right . How about the 30th at 4:00 p . m . ? -- Is an hour enough ?
You have an unusual accent , Mr . Robbins . Where are you from originally ? If you don ' t mind me asking .
Can you describe their taste ?
What does MI mean ?
How much is the service charge ?
OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part .

Six days or so .
Let's go to work . We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening .
Sure , no problem .
But I ' Ve reserved a room the day before yesterday .

Why would I spy on you ?
Let's plan a surprise party for him !

It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters .
You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
How much would you like ?
The company will have to choose a good advertising firm . And then there's the problem of quality . How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ?

It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it .

I have this list of stuff that I need and I only have half the dough .
When did that happen ?
Do you know what the temperature is today ?
No , that ' s no problem . I ' m sorry to hear you ' re not feeling well . Get some rest . If you need to see a doctor , let me know .

Nothing ?

Howdy folks , and welcome to today ' s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals .
It ' s my pleasure .
That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ?
The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .
Cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park .
All right . Is your companion leaving for Shanghai with you ?
Our offer is RIB 300 per tape-recorder , F . O . B . Tianjin .

You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ...
I remember . What time do they need to be there ?
Hey , John . Nice car .
That sounds appealing . OK , we will have that .
I think they need a little trimming .
How do you know ? You haven ' t seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable .
That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans !
Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ?
Yes . I can't find my sweater . I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done . I find my swatter missing .
Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester .
On July 7 , I have to be there well before twelve o ' clock .
Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I'd say it's really a special art form .
It's a camera .
I didn ' t say I ' d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference .
That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you .
Okay , what time is my meeting in London ?
Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ?
Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you .
Do you know a bus that goes to the Gold Line station ?

They are $ 168 .
How much luggage can I take for my flight ?
How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ?
Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ?
I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning .
Today is my wife's birthday , so I want to buy a bouquet for her .

Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then .
I feel I work harder when I am under pressure .
So what did you get ?
Come upstairs .
Yes , here is the form .

Wang , I'd like you to meet my friend . Dou , this is Wang .
Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty . OK ?
Yes , I worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl .
So what ?
everything's great . And you ?
Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
Yes . And I took many pictures .
Well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision .
oh , why ?
Do you know anyone in the play ?
How about these ? They are nine yuan each .
I ' d like a standard room .
My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
How long is the ride ?
You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks'study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
Shall I right out again first ?
All I get is a black screen .
It could be bad food , but I didn ' t feel so well yesterday , either .
A post order for four hundred dollars .
Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back .

I thought it was over there .

Nice to meet you too , Mr . Zhang .

Exactly , it was my favorite class .
OK , no problem .
well . It ' s not all my fault , Anna ...
It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard .

Don't worry , it's not serious . You will get better soon .

If you plan on eating , you are .

What the others ?
I have to go shopping today .
What are you going to buy ?
Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals .
It's a nice cinema , isn't it ?
I'm tired .
How was your flight ?
True . Well , see you tomorrow .
You mean Lily's boyfriend ?
You don ' t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts !

If you are staying here for a few days , we ' d be delighted to see you at our factory .
Could I be of any help to you ?
What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ?

Yeah . But I ...
I'll refund your money right now .
How about mileage and gas ?
Come on , darling . We haven't got much time .

Would you tell me the general description of your present job ?
Keep your fingers crossed . She'll bring home the bacon .
Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition is usually pretty low .
What're the teams ?
Why not come here and have a look at the guidebook ?
Or just stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once !
Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt !
Perhaps the food was bad .

I ' m so glad you told me that .
I don't think that you're done .
What don't you like about it ?

Let's go to the cinema by bus .
Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ?
You know . I really don't those big hotels .
Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ' ll marry you !
Would you show me some table-cloths ?
Again !
Money is not the only standard to decide your career . In fact , there are more important things you can refer to when evaluating your career . If I were you , I would choose one I like to do .
Honey , it doesn't matter . The key to play volleyball is to cooperate with each other .
It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you .
We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful .
I usee I would say that would be moving out of my parents ' house for the first time .
I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows . Are you kidding ?
How are your stocks doing , Jim ?
Are you crazy ? You were cheating .

I can ' t find the business card . Do you know the address ?
Wow , what a lovely cake .
For here or to go ?
Okay . Come with me .
Oh , yes . Erm , well , could you tell me your name , please ?
The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer .
Where exactly are you coming from ?
Good afternoon , can I help you ?
It doesn't matter , sir . Shoes will stretch a bit with use .
Same here . Hey , did you know Susan is going to get married . She invited me to her wedding and she wants you to attend also .
Yeah , yeah , whatever .
I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back .
Anything I can do for you ?
She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months .
Wonderful . I'd like to know why you're interested in this position at our paper .
I don't know . Do you like snowing ?
I ' m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
Is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ' t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one .
I'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . I need your understanding .
Great ! Where is it ?
Let me see if I can fit you in . What kind of room do you want ?
Did you enjoy your meal ?
That ' s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ' s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer .
What time does the recycle truck come by ?
I have learned English for 10 years , and I have passed College English test level 4 and 6 .
Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month .
You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible .
That's good to hear . Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me .
Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave .
Mark ? I need that file you took yesterday .
Is that true ?
I can recommend an apartment for you . A friend of mine is about to move . She doesn ' t want to rent that house any longer .
I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference . Is that right ?
If there were any major problems , I would always notify you by phone to come in .
Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ?
What does the company mainly do ?
if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it .
But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money .
Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ?
Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...
but I still love you .
Is there a dead animal somewhere in here ?
Anytime except today . Please give him a call before you come .
French dressing , please .
It looks like it's going to be sunny .

I like to stay here .
Yes . I need a tow truck . My car is broken down .
Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ?
Is that Hello Kitty ?
Oh , Cindy did mention you before . You're Alexander Newman .

Ha-ha , see you then .
I'm sorry , this is our rock bottom price .
My mother taught me some tricks of the trade . I've always loved jewelry .
Sure . I suggest you take a bus there . It's a bit too long for you to walk there .
I believe that 10 % is just about right amount .
It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult .
Would you like regular car wash package ?
All right . Which kind do you prefer ?
I know why Mr . Fro didn't like our ad idea ! He doesn't know the first thing about coffee .
But I make it .
You ' d better change it . It ' s ugly .
Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends ...
How beautiful the flower is !
OK ! Just give her this for me !
Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ?
Well , I love hip hop dancing , so I should probably dance . Do you know how to rap ?
Yes , this is the Resume Writing Workshop . Welcome !
Hi , I would like to make a dinner reservation .
Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow .

I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner I had yesterday .
Yes , I think it is possible more important than the salary .
Good morning , Mr . Zhang .

You stink !
I want a different hair style .
Is the security door useful ?

I wonder if you can change it to one size down .

Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
Oh , right . You ' re in our system . I was just looking under Li . So , we ' Ve got you down for a Business Suite for three days . If I could just have your credit card , I ' ll process your check-in while
Does this dress look OK on me ?
How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ?
Never .
Not really many . I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain .
No , you're right . But nudity doesn't bother me . What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation , stuff like that . It was too sick .
Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates .
Yeah . Here .
Actually , that's not true . Acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places .
You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .
Of course not . Just tell me how to operate it .
Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts .
It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do .
Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ?
An apartment ? Why ?
Is this a furry hat ?
I used to shop there , but I find the food at Whole Foods to be a lot better .
Yes , Dad ?

Good idea . I like hanging out in bars at night .

That's very good !
But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ?
Fantastic ! I ' ll be there !

A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart .
Good evening , Mr . Wu .
You're probably right , do you intend on going to the party ?
That ' s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
How are your wedding plans going ?
I think it suits you well .
There were some famous ugly women in history .
Yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
I see . Should I have it bound ?

ok . Should I heat the wok ?
She likes to golf , dance , and eat foreign food .
so , you must be pretty interested in photography then .
Mom , we can keep it on the balcony , right ?
Yes , I did . But I couldn't communicate with them in English . They speak only Spanish . So I need your help .
It feels good .
The TV's still here .
I don't understand . We were getting along so well .
Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience .
Oh , yeah . I ' m there !
I'm afraid he is not in at the moment .
Are you still going to write me a ticket ?
Is everything OK , Madam ?
So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
I'll get it for you right now .
Just a moment , please . I'm sorry , sir . There is no ticket available on that day . But we have flights for Guangzhou the next day .
I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors .
well , my hosue-mates and I are having a house-warming party . Would you like to come ?
Yes . I'll be with you in a second . Yes , sir ? What is the problem ?
Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there .
About a 100 and I have had them declared .
First , your overwhelming share in the world market . Second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . Third , the diversity in your production line is second to none .
And you got them off the Net ?
You remember me ! Yes , I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters .
I'd like to open a one-year time deposit account and a checking account .
That ' s okay . They describe everything on the ballot .

Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor .
If I get work for a few weeks , will I be terminated from EDD ?
Twenty dollars and sixty cents .
Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ' s favorite pastime .
How can I tell if they're ripe ?
How much do I owe you ?
So the company will pay for everything ?
have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ?
Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the post office ?
Very smart !
What kind do you want ?
I am going there , too . We can walk together .
Yes , I do . We ' re doing pretty well this season . We ' Ve won most of our games , but we ' re not top of the league table .
Oh , probably you've been working too hard .
Who ' s that ?
How will you spend this lovely weekend ?
So you'll make the Stars . com deadline , and have us up and running next week ?
I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ?
May I see your ticket and passport , please ?
I found a mouse in our house , a grown mouse running around the dinning room .
No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best .
Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof .
May I ask your telephone number ?
No problem . How would you like your suit ?
No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now .
I'm just fishing from the shore . How about you ?
OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you .
But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it .
it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own .
Is it expensive ?
No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ...
that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry .
How about your study at college ?
I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .
Thanks for coming , it was a real blessed .
True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade .
That's a good idea , Charlotte .
I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . What time does our meeting start ? Where is everyone anyway ?
Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
Can I help you pack ?
Why are we watching it anyway ?
I would like to switch it to next Friday .
Could you stay a little longer ?
Ok , Goodbye .
Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ?
You were when we were in high school . That , and baseball .
Let me take a look . Just a second . That ' s no problem , Susan . See you on Wednesday .
How about make up ?
Leave me alone !
Yes , this coming Saturday .
Will you go with me , too ?
Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ' t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works .
When did it start ?
You should do something else .
Could you give me more paper napkins ?
I can give you one for $ 30 a day or $ 200 a week .
Oh , no . That's bad news .
Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football .
Not too tight in the waist ?
Yeah , at least .
let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age !
Do you have a ride home ?
Fine , I'll make it .
I'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
It costs money , dear . What ' s wrong with the regular television stations ?
New England .

Great , so we can afford the new apartment after all !
There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month .
Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners .
What did you want to get ?
Yes . I have a great team working with me .
Don't worry . It will take time to accumulate experience . You need to be confident for yourself .
What do you dislike most about your job ?
All right , sir . Would you lie back so that I can shave you ?
Generally it will arrive within three days .
What sandwich did you order ?
I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute .
Does that mean you're going to take my advice ?
We'll have to get you to a hospital for an X-ray .
Alright , you'd better hurry , your bus is coming .
That ' s right . But I don ' t think there are better ways .
And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
Let's see what else is on first .
I ' m interested in teaching at your school .
thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight .
I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much .
I see . You've got a cold .
Certainly sir , we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services , call waiting and also three way calling .
have you finished going through the contract ?
Addison .
The traffic problem will soon be eased .
But it's Saturday ! !
So what did you do ?
Excuse me , what's the price of a single room ?
All right . But so help me it better work .
it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time !
If you'd like , I can send someone to fix it right now .
Are you an existing customer ?
What do you think about occupational planning ?
I wonder what happened .
No . I haven ' t had the pleasure .
I don ' t try to go ahead of people and lead them , I ' d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together .
Sure . What ' s it about ?
perhaps I ' m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests !
There's a 20 percent service charge in this hotel .
Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him .
Oh , right . This one , right ?
He was 20 years old then .
Yes , of course . I have to go there every Tuesday .
Sounds fine .
Don't worry . It would be back again a little later .
It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime .
Yes , I will get you one .
Mark is parade his knowledge again .
Yes . You must put on her name and address .
It's already on sale now .
Yeah , it ' s me . Can you give me a lift after work ?
R :: Thank you , sir . For which date and how many guests will there be in your party ?
Was it on the shelf ?
Yes , I'd like to make reservation for tonight , a table for five , please .
My pronunciation is not very good . It's L-I-N , Lin .
Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work .
You can always wash cars and sell candy .
Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break , meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know .
Wait a minute , that ? ... Doughnuts ? They organic doughnuts , Kelly ?
I take more than 50 courses in university , including microeconomics , macroeconomics , marketing principles , sales management , statistics , and so on .
Mr Edgar , hello ! How's business ? Still booming ? What can we do for you today ?

The website will give you a normal range and then tell you what your results are .

I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ?
Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ?
All right . I hope I'll be able to enjoy my stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
What ' s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ' t belong .

Well , generally in the U . S . each university has its own outstanding fields . But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th .
Okay , so are you going to school tomorrow ?
I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers .
The delivery people showed up four hours late .
Just a few minutes . I need to make a list of the things that we need .

Could you elaborate on that ?

How could you know ?
My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me .

Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .
Mmmm ... I know ! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . What do you think ?
You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
The deposit rate is 0 . 8 % every month .
Where'd the rest of your money for the bus go ?
I don ' t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ' s resolution yourself .
Why are you in such a hurry ?
You found an apartment in the ads ?
150 pounds .
You're complaining again .
I missed it . I watch a live show of a concert .
No . We couldn ' t possibly .
Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ?
OK . OK . I don't want to haggle with you . Let's say , how about 3 . 5 % ?
Your name and room number , please ?
oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ?
Welcome . How can I help you ?
I'm in a bit of a hurry , Miss Liu . Can you wait for a minute ?

Well , I ' ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .

Which is more interesting to you , flying kites or going roller-skating ?
Is that shrimp in the soup ?
Thank you for your reminding . Yes , please have it dry cleaned .
Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind .
What kind of people you find hard to work with ?
How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ?
Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .
Gongshan Development Co . , Ltd . may I help you ?
Good afternoon , anything I can do for you ?
Thank you very much . We really had a good time .

How may I help you today ?
We're not turning on the heater in May ! You need to take a bath . We'll heat you up and see if you can sweat this thing out .
I see . But why don't you continue to work as a teacher ?
How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak ?
And would you like to order now ?
If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ .
When can you start the job ?
I mean , you must register first before you send a card .
It does , but it won't connect to anything .
Will the blood test hurt ?
I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong .
She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come .
According to what you did last time , I have my doubts .
Good ! Where is it ?
Do you know that song ?
Did you do you own stunts in the movie ?

He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week .
I went to get mine from IKEA .

You should take their advice . They know what's best for you .
OK . Now you dial 9 on the keypad . Do you hear the tone change ?
Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat .
Is there any water damage ?
All these countries in two weeks ?
It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it .
If you'd just give me your number and insurance , then I'll handle it .
Could you tell me the advantages of it ?
The maid has just delivered some laundry to my room . But it's not mine at all .
A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ' s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me .
But when and why did you leave the company ?
What a washing machine ! It ' s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ' t work at all . I think I need a new one .
I'm sorry . I'll ask next time .

Whatever am i going to tell me parents .

Calvin , how much money did you spend last weekend ?

So that's why it ' s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner .
I want you to have a walk with me .

Steven , have you got better now ?

I did , too . Come and visit us again , will you ?
How much is it ? Eight films and a bar of chocolate .
If you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours , you may qualify .
No , not yet .
As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ?
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ?
I prefer to go there next time .
Sure . While you ' re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
I may just do that .
So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip ?
What is most important to you in a job ?
Really ? Great ! We will . Well , what's your flight number ? When are you leaving tomorrow ?
Is this your umbrella , miss ?
No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .
Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with .
Check the drawer .
Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game .
It's absolutely free ?
Yes , but I don't like the story .
The initial amount is just 2,000 RIB , but we can go up to 100,000 RIB . But remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral .
Yes , the shoes on that shelf are on sale now . They are much cheaper .
The restaurant is on the second floor . Here is the key to your room . It's on the 6th floor , room 609 . The elevator is over there . And we also have a cafeteria on the top floor , if you would like something to drink , you can also call room service .
You ' Ve got a great personality .
I bet it is always full of cars .
Good . I'll give you a call tonight .
David , imagine meeting you here !
How far are you going ?
I think it ' s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them .
One family skeleton of my family was that my younger brother has an axe to grind .
How nice ! Are you going to convert some RIB to US dollars ?
OK , I will take it . By the way , does the price include breakfast ?
Yes , I see . Go home to bed and take one of these pills every three hours .
Are you sure this is the right restaurant ?
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ?
As long as it doesn't take too long .
But you should tell me you were in love with her .

At our club .
We surely believe you .
OK , I promise . You promise you will be well soon ?
We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents .
Yes , I think so . The suit matches the trousers .
That would be over by the paper towels and toilet paper .
Are there any other cities where it's always hot ?
Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ?
So many ?
I graduated and now want to get a BA .
What is your career objective ?
I want to open a savings account .
It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time .
Good night .
So , I should choose that one ?
Yes . We have all kinds of colors for it .
They don't have a lot of organic foods there .
if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money .

Did she ask you any questions about your family ?
I think we're finished . Can you please turn off the lights and shut the door ?

Absolutely right . He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto . That caused a sensation . The audience were stunned by his pure tone .
I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations .
I passed college English Test Band - 4 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ' t think certificates are necessary if what's needed is merely operating a computer .

My brother gave me a baby cat yesterday . I can keep it as my pet .

Are you listening to me , Dan ?
Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage .

This seems a pretty nice room , I should say .
Woo . It has such a long history . I think I should take more photos of the university .
What about the next day ?

I am sorry , miss , it's not allowed unless you want to buy it .
Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen .

A deposit , huh ? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit .
That ' s something we can discuss later .
The song you hear now .
Can I list my interests next ?
Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' .
That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit .
There will be a refund when I return the card , right ?
Well , I know you are pretty busy these days . But we have got to work fast on this . Otherwise , we'll lose the market .

We are interested in cloth made in China . The clothes are sold very well here . We are a big location supplier for the northeast market here . I'm thinking that we'll have some business opportunities .

You should feel shameful for your behavior .
Will you please put your luggage on the scale ?

I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .
If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction .

Yes , but it's quite a ways .
That ' s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ' d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels .
Now , why do you want to exchange it ?
No . I'd just like a refund .
You see . I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U . S . Dollar .
Which direction were you coming from ? And which direction were you going ?
Of course , have a seat .
Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes ?
Hi , Steven . What's new with you ?
The Cross Bakery building ? Oh sure . You're actually walking in the opposite direction .
Do you have enough money to buy that dress ?
Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy .
Look , if you don ' t love me , it ' s not a thing , alright , we ' Ve had our laughs , but I don ' t appreciate ... maybe it ' s just time we ...
I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .
I need you to take a look at these samples . I think there are a few problems .
I had a busy morning .
Do you feel like dancing ?
Uh ... that's Greek to me .
Yes . Thank you for inviting me .
Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ?
How well can you speak them ?
Then , I'll just trim it .
Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad .
I wish I had studied here . It's more than a university .
How about you , Daniel ?
How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ?
I see . Do you have your Current All-in-one Passbook with you ? I'll need your password for this transaction .
I guess so . It comes and goes .
It's so beautiful .
Just focus on us and press the button .
and you can still go " window shopping " just like in a real shopping mall .
For whom ? Cortex ?
Where there are difficulties , there are ways to get over them . Hold on !
OK , here's to your health .
Fill it up . I will have a tour tomorrow .
Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival .
Thank you for your compliments . It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ?
It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 .
Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ' s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off .
I have , actually . How about the movie , Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood ?
It may be worse than it seems . How's it feel ?
It's much better now . Thank you .
you know she probably feels just as bad .
Let me see it .
Don ' t you know they have had little affection for each other ?
Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here .
How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ' m Song Mei .
I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .
Oh , I don't care about that .
Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment .
Well , I'm only making one copy , so I guess I can afford it .
My name is Han Ran , number is 050920 .
Do you want cheese on it ?
Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract .
Come on , let's talk about it .
Next june .
No problem . Do you want the money to go by M / T or T / T ?
Here you are . Thank you and have a nice evening .
Here's the bath .
Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?
The police officer that pulled me over said I was speeding .
Some guy on the street just mugged me .
Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ' m just fine .
What kind of people do you like to work with ?
Well , since it's summer , and I had looked that you had quite a bit sun , I'll recommend our summer special , it's specially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .
Why do I need to do that ?
I'm fine , thanks . And you ?
Yes , thank you . I want to get a handbag .
No . 10 % is my last word .
Let ' s do it !
Yes , it is still covered by our warranty . Tell me the mode number of your vacuum , please .
No wonder you're such a wacko ...
I apologize , and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again .
I might . what did you do yesterday ?
Do you offer a course in business management ?
Absolutely .
That is nice . But I don't quite like the collar .
Yes . I would like to go to New York for my Christmas vacation .
When is your birthday ?
Hi , I ' m Susan Marshall , You can call me Susan . Nice to meet you .
Ok . Let's call it a deal .
And you'll repair the television , won't you ?
I am calling to cancel it now . I can't go to your city this week .
I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music .
This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ?
Yes . We are looking for someone who are well-educated and have all-round experience as a manager .
Your niece will love this . Anything else ?
What kind of car is it ?
that's too bad . Maybe another time .
You ' re welcome . It was good seeing you again .
No , I assure you .
I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
My washing machine isn't working .
We can buy that for you .
I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ?
I agree . I ' m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ' t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways .
Well , good-bye . See you soon .
Anyway , the host team seems to fight for the gold .
Really ? You've done a good job .
Yes , I think I can help you . Why not you come around and see me ? Do you know my office ?
Oh , nothing in particular , I guess . I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines .
Yes . I'd like to book a room , please .
It's hard to say . The stock market is weird . You never know what will happen tomorrow .
Yes , of course sir . What's your name and your room number , PLS ?
There's a question I want to ask you .
That same morning I have some business to take care of .
This is Doris . Who's calling please ?
Let ' s look at the newspaper .
I hope so . Thanks .
I think that we should let someone know . They will probably want to fix the problem .
Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle .
Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours .
I suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman .
OK , Hello !
Oh , my niece will love her ! How much for her ?
You really like it ?
Hello , Jane . What do you do in your spare time ?
Maybe . How much is a room ?
OK , it so happened I want to buy one .
I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable .
Mary , set your alarm clock for seven tomorrow morning .
Let me explain . To get more cash , I'll have to borrow more from Vital , the venture capitalists .
I should say it is something we have never come across before .
When does the library close ?
Let's go and play volleyball .
of course . Is the dinner still on ?
Do you have s second ?
NYU was my first choice .
Looks not bad .
Yes , sir . We have the all-inclusive luxury cruise . Maybe you would like to look at the itinerary .
The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
Hey , honey I ' m back . Wow , the house looks really good !
In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports .
That's wonderful news , thanks for all your help .
You mean you've never had a boyfriend ?
Please write down your name , address and the amount of your deposit here . And please choose a passcode of six numbers and confirm it .
yes , do you like it ?
What time does the office close ?
I've got to be going now too .
I can't do that , Zina . You know I can't .
Actually , I'd prefer not to be .
I don ' t have a library card .
I don ' t think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer .
It ' s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But now it ' s the evening rush .
Good evening ! I don't believe we've met before . May I introduce myself ? My name is Jack .
You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall .
But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth .
I can leave the parcel with you , can't I ?
Have you got anything cheaper ?
Just a few Christmas gifts , to this season , after all !
Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ?
I know of a place you'll like and you have got to be there .
I'm not sure . Let me think about it .
I graduated from Hebes University .
Tell me something about your Valentine's Day .
Who was the conductor ?
Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
Okay then . And I also want to have my hair colored .
Could you please tell me when your laundry opens and closes ?
What kind of sports ?
Yes . I have reserved a table for 2 at 7:30 . My name is Bob .
I didn ' t think about it like that .
Sorry . I'm afraid we can't . But you may order something else instead .
Yes , I know .
Tell me what the problem is .
What is this test for ?
Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ?
Well , I was looking in this magazine the other day and cruises are not very expensive at all . Take a look at this !
That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ?
Why don't you look outside ?
At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go .
Please , Julia , I have made proposal to you five times . I really want to share the rest of my life with you .
I see . It's safer then right ?
Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny . I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time .
Reservation , please .
No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man .
Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ?
It's on the tip of my tongue . I think it starts with a ' B ' .
Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ' Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ' s too much information on the net .
Really ? I like rainy days . The moisture in the air is good for my skin .
Where are you going to go look for one ?
I want a chicken salad .
Twenty days .
That ' s just what I need . Thanks so much . You ' Ve been a big help already .
Can ' t you remember the days when you had the hots for me ?
You can apply for one here .
I think it leaves at two-thirty .
Oh , shut up , Roy .
Do you have some good ideas of losing weight ?
Hello , james . Come in . go through to the living room .
Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ?
Laura told me today that she has a friend with a car for sale .
I really would rather just listen . Isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ?
I ' Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross .
Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month .
Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together .
I don ' t care ! You are grounded for life , mister !
Hello , miss . I would like to check out .
Now you should know the rest . Don't forget to dial Taipei's city code .
yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early .
What'll you have ?
Of course ! Where are the things ?
En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets .
I ' Ve a lot of paper work to do right now . I ' m behind schedule .
Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom .
What's the temperature ?
So you don't have much related work experience .
Yes . We have reservations .
I am sorry , it ' s not decided by me but by the company .
Sorry , we have student cards . We can get discounts with these , can't we ?
How long do you want the subscription for ?
Yes , it is . As you know , some of the materials we use are highly-flammable so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory .
No , you don't . We use computers now .
What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ?
Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ?
No , I ' m sorry . You ' Ve reached Mr . Macmillan ' s office . Let me just put you through to accounting .
I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ?
They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
This is he . May I help you ?
He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom .
One bottle of perfume and a watch .
I'm scared .
You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy !
Two hours . That area is a little backward .
Sorry , sir , in order to protect these paintings , taking photos are strictly forbidden here .
Thanks for the warning , Mom .
I'm sorry , but I really need it this afternoon .
They give you discounts on some stuff that you want to buy .
May I have a look at this ?
There aren't enough buses in this city , are there ?
Bo , of course not . He is still single .
I see . I ' m sure you ' ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him .
I'll see if I can adjust it .
I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook .
Well , what about price ?
That ' s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ' s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , a Chilean , a New Zealander , though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi . Who else do we have ? Oh , we also have a Moroccan , a Togolese , a Pakistani , and two Indonesians !
Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on .
I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ?
Terrible .
Say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer .
Fall is the best season in Beijing . It's neither hot nor cold . The sky is clear and blue . There's hardly any wind , only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable . And we have plenty of sunshine too .
Good , thanks . How about you ?
A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ?
Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ?
I went to Yale University .
How much is the charge ?
How silly John is .
What did they take ?
I have a housing contract with the university . I'll be in a dorm room on campus .
I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ?
I think you will enjoy your journey .
Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms .
Twenty minutes exactly .
Here you are . Thanks for your wonderful service .
Mr . Chen , are you sure you're taking BA - 007 back to Tokyo ?
Uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on .
This is Peter Kaufman .
You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner !
You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet .
Just take it easy . If he starts to bother you , let me know and I'll call security .
Which Channel is it ?
Well , nobody's perfect !
Do I need to do anything else after I turn in the application ?
But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit .
Thank you . And where can I get a pushcart ?
I really couldn't understand him .
No . I'd like to do something special for you on your birthday .
With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment .
I need to go to the bank .
Anything else bothering you ?
Well , I don't know .
I want some pickles , oh , and we ' re out of flour . Put that on the list , too .
A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood .
Great , thanks a lot ! I hope to hear from you ! Good bye .
Sorry . There's no one named Li Lin here . Are you sure you have the right name ?
to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him .
I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you .
not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ?
No , I only know four great beauties of China .
We could find a classical one .
I want to use these coupons . Have they expired ?
I am not sure . I just can't connect to the net .
Did you go diving while you were there ?
No , I ' ll call the attendants at the gate . I will tell them you ' re on your way .
Uh ... yeah .. of course !
Good morning , sir ! Can I help you ?
Yes , I'd like to know if the company provides opportunities for further education .
Would you like to apply for one right now ?
Actually , my office is right around the corner .
No , I didn't get hurt . Thanks for your concern .
It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine .
I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse .
Take it easy . Be confident of yourself . I'm sure you can do it .
I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .
Good . There is the information desk . How do we get to seventieth street , please ?
I'm not familiar with American size .
Are you through with your meal ?
Well . I like the Thorn Birds best .
Now , many people think that women ' s liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . What is your opinion ?
Everywhere I look , I see cockroaches .
Bring me a bottle of beer .
180 yuan .
Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ' s boyfriend .
Could you give me a taxi to pick me up and take me to the airport before 1:00 p . m . ?
She takes classes in accounting and business .
Yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early .
To tell the truth , I don ' t really like him either . He ' s kind of boring and not very active . He always looks unhappy too .
Wonderful . That's just what I expect , where is my first place if I go there ?
A $ 100,000 policy shouldn ' t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He ' ll give you a good deal .
Honey , what's up ?
That's helpful for your health .
Oh ... I go to see my sister twice a year or so .
O . K . Thanks , Mom !
Do you have an account with us ?
Did the cops find out why he flew into the U . S . ?
Oh , dear ! How ruthless !
May I asked why you are interested in working for us ?
it must have been a few years ago now .
How are you going to do that ?
They promised us a sea view .
Thanks . You know , I just noticed that these eggs are fried , and I ordered scrambled .
Since it is , I need a haircut with shampoo .
Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song .
what do you think about her as a boss ?
I know that .
My paper is on the influence of television on children .
Where's Gate 12 ?
Would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking .
I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball .
Have you met my wife , Mary ?
I don ' t know any of the laws they ' re trying to pass .
No , not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight , but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there .
that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager .
David Bush .
Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air .
Can I try it on and see how it looks ?
I'm sorry , sir , we don't have one . However , in our gym , we do have swim stations .
By warming up before and cooling down after your workout .
Can you give me a hand with my luggage ?
I think it is .
Would you mind my keeping it for another week ?
But I hear that the card is free .
How may I help you . sir ?
Thank you very much !
Is that very likely in England ?
I take sleeping pills sometimes .
How many stops are there ?
Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ' Brian ?
Don't worry about it . I've got another one I can use .
Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece !
I need to find a new place to live .
That ' s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss .
Two tickets , please .
I got a car , so the distance wouldn ' t really be a problem .
Sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . And alcohol is not allowed .
And that ?
Do you like working in teams ?
Okay , I'll make you some food .
We are going to have a party tonight , would you please look after our baby tonight ?
Yes , would you please call me a taxi first ?
I hate this part of school .
I'd like to get a good RPG . Can you recommend any ?
Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love .
I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person .
Ma'am , I'm sorry . The cancer ward said Mr . Smith passed away two days ago .
It is enough for today . Do you have any last question ? If not , thank you for taking your time to come to our interview .
Oh , yes . You ?
What are the different workshops that are available at the EDD offices ?
You can ask the teacher for help .
Yes , there is a 10 percent discount .
Let ' s just hope my teacher agrees .
What if I repay it early . Any perks ?
Wait a moment .
Let me examine you . Don ' t worry . It ' s nothing serious .
I only paid two dollars for mine .
I'll clean my room before I leave .
It ' s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang . How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ' s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff .
You mean it will arrive two hours later than usual ?
Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake .
I can ' t believe it !
Well , I wish you good luck !
One of my friends tells me that his company is hiring in a large scale and he wants me to go for an interview .
More than 100 times . The flight takes off at 12:00 .
Did the cops get him ?
It was hard work .
You are very nice to tell me those .
I feel the same way . It smells so good after it rains .
You heard who won the election , right ?
What kind of room would you like , madam ?
That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now .
I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way .
Let ' s try to get out of the supermarket quickly .
Sounds good !
I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks .
I can't forget about this when next time .
For my credit worthiness ?
You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ' t affect her decision .
Don't tell me , socks .
I wouldn ' t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
How much must I pay ?
Hmm ... okay , here ' s the thing . I ' Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ' t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ' t you ?
Exactly . That's what we have done in the past .
I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child .
It's rather expensive , isn't it ?
This bus doesn't take you directly there . You ' d have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes .
Ah ...
That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up .
I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc .
If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long .
So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ?
Yes , on Monday .
Hi , Jack ! How are you doing ?
Are your vegetables a little mushy ?
Can I buy stamps here ?
I hope so too .
yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time .
What is this , the new Ford ?
Why ' s that ?
It ' s very nice meeting you , too .
What are your plans ?
If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze , but a few people said that they couldn ' t go , so I think it should be ok ?
But she means a lot to me .
All right . Let's go to the square to have a look .
I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want .
Well . I would like my hair cut shorter on the temples .
Here it is , and here we are .
The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
Well , I ' m not going to answer it . I ' m sleeping .
Look at that pretty girl .
Yes , you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like .
I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan .
Hi , Martin . I ' Ve been looking for you all morning .
Can you give me a hand ?
Ok , I know you are not a resident of Beijing . Where is your domicile place then ?
I don't think it's broken .
I'm going to refund your money right now .
okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later .
What food are we out of ?
Of course . In my opinion , you are the strongest candidate for the job .
That ' s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ' t they ?
Well , I ' Ve been working so hard lately , so I ' ll probably just take it easy .
it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans
was it his first offence ?
I'm just comparing prices .
Just stop here for a moment . The police will not notice .
You're welcome . I hope you'll be more comfortable in your new room .
( After watching the movie . ) Are you crying ?
You can get dressed as soon as the film is processed . We will be all done here .
A great deal of people follow rugby in my country .
That ' s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .
Would you like cream or sugar in your coffee ?
You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ?
Got it ! Did you fill up the tank ?
Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one !
I think I can accept that .
But i donor like it , not a bit , i am not a pet , i am a girl .
I am sorry , but I don't have one with me right now .
I guess you miss your wife and children very much .
It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday .
You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer .
Wow that ' s great news ! They ' re a great couple !
Please wait a moment .
Frankly speaking , I ' m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ' t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late .
Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week .
Did you smell something ? It smells so great .
I won ' t be able to give you back your deposit .
It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas .
Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time .
No , you don't .
I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .
Please call if you have any other requests . Your food will be delivered promptly .
Are you looking for a small , medium , or large pan ?
I am sorry . We are full up for tomorrow .
That's a good idea . Which one do you recommend ? The Pairszone ?
Yes , may I have some more beer ?
Some are genuine . But all our reproductions are clearly marked and priced .
Have you gone bowling before ?
not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too .
How much for a bus pass ?
Hello ? Is that Mark ?
Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ?

Well , he ' s got dark hair and brown eyes .
Don't mention it . It's been my pleasure .
I suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . In this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . In my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much .
Me too . Have a great day .

What is your reservation number ?
Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London .
Would you like an appetizer ?
I have no idea about what to do next .
Yes , you should pay half of the cost in advance .
That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal .
No problem . You know him . He ' s the kind of guy that ' s always willing to go the extra miles .
Good luck to you .
I think it would be a great joke . But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us . So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .
Someone has stolen my gold necklace .
Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well .

Better late than never .
We'll have to talk this over some more .
She told me she'd be here .
Oh , Mr Green , my name is Jianshan . You don't know me , but I'm a friend of David Smith .
I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older .
Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked .
Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know . And your English is very good . You sound like an American .
Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows .
See you tonight then .
It ' s been a long time since I ' Ve had to look for work and put a resume together .
Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me .
Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
Hello . What can I do for you ?
Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ?
Welcome to our company .
Well , you guys work hard for it . It ' s really beautiful .

Single , please . How much in total ?
I don't like being too tired the next day .

Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students .
In my mind , salary is not the most important thing .
Let me show you , the one with curly hair .
Have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
I'm going to study .
The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them !

I'll have a whole-wheat loaf , three white loaves , a baguette and ten rolls , please . How much is that ?
Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ?
Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ?
No , that's okay , I already have a coke . Why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day .
Yes , that is why I usually choose dark colours for my business suits .
If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know .
Sure . Go straight ahead and you'll walk into it .
Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile .

Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ' s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport !

OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see !
I really need to lose some weight . I should go on a diet .
I heard it might rain .

You should communicate with the interviewer whose company you are interested in , and make a good impression on him or her . In that case , your chance of success will be greater .
That would be great ! How about 2:30 ?
What do you want to see particularly ?
Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles .
I didn't say I was going to deprive myself .
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ?
So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future .

Yes , you can . Please put your articles in this envelope and seal it .
OK . I would like to have my receipt report , please .
Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products .

Amy , could you help me with this work ?
Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ?
But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China .
It is all right . I will call the boss and tell him I am staying another day . I stayed an extra night in Boston last month and he didn ' t seem to put about it .
Yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir .
I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today .
You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down !
Interesting ...
Sure . First you pick up the receiver and hit one of the first 3 buttons . Do you hear a tone ?
Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ?
There's going to be a highway here .

Beauty costs , honey .
I also need some thumbtacks , whiteout and paper clips . Which shelf are they on ? I can't find the number .
Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ?
I don't think I share your view there . The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on . It ' s too hard to understand .
She is a clever mother .
When is it most convenient for me to visit you to talk about the position ?
Alright .
God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking .
Oh , it's really popular these days .
Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too .
Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves . It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market .
It ' s for a book .
Oh , that's nice . Thank you for arranging all of this .
I think so . Here it is . It ' s by the basin .
Forgive me . You're 100 percent correct . Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor .
Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee .
I like baseball the best .
Yes , honey . Go to your room , and take out your book . It's your reading time now .
That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ' t be able to have all that furniture in your room .
. I have a house in the suburbs .
I think salary is closely related to the responsibilities of the job . Shall we discuss my responsibilities with your company first ?
That maybe true , and I for one don ' t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ' re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ' re asking for money ! That is just not right !
I think our child is going to love it !

Okay . See you then .
I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time .
Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department .
I am sorry , we will connect with the room service . Please Warta moment .

I haven't ever cared for that myself .
Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer .
We have many kinds of glasses here . Which frames do you like best ?
Shall I go ahead and process them for you ?
I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in .
Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
Yes . Just go there !
Yes . Would you please kindly tell him I want to apply for a proof-reader in your newspaper ?

Well , you certainly didn ' t choose her because of her looks ! Hey , I was joking ! Don ' t hit me !
All right . You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment . The fertilizers will be delivered before April .
No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ' t you noticed that ?
Can I pay by private check ?
I got two . We can go there together .
I like all kinds of stuff . I admit I love romance .

That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ?

Mary , you have found several companies that are hiring , right ?
If you have any questions about it , please don't hesitate to tell me . I'll go . Bye .
Good morning . I'd like to have a haircut .
It ' s pretty bad .
Excuse me . I need some storybooks in easy English . Do you have anything like that ?
We should make it , if there isn't too much traffic .
You gossip ! What's the basis of your opinion ?
I am not sure how to add a class .
Rice .
When was that ?
OK , let me tell you what we ' Ve been doing . We ' Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ' re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment .

A little distraction might do you some good , Zina .
I am reading a book about money management .

Hey , Jim . Wake up !
We got off too early , didn't we ?
Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !
Let me see them . Yes , they're OK .
Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled .
There are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . There is a high standard of living . People earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . So there isn ' t so much money after all .
A barber shop ? !
Mr . : Here . Write your name inside the front cover . Remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester , so keep it in good condition .
Ok . Then I can make up my mind .
Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four .
Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare .
well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ?

Do you have a moment ?
This is not what I asked for , I'm afraid .

It ' s hard to say . Language isn ' t like other studies .
The 19:00 train .
Certainly , sir . How much rent did you want to pay ?
I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .
That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration -- and that's enough !
I can ' t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing .
Let's switch the lights on .
I'd like a ticket for that flight please .
Have a nice evening .
oh , no . not at all .
Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day .
Do you think I should join the basketball team , Mary ?

Yes . Have a look .
I know they aren't good for you , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty .

I'm so sorry . Kindly tell me what the problem is , sir .
Yes , I have a driving license .
But it is far from downtown . Living here is very inconvenient .
May I have your name please ?
I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it .
Yes , certainly , you have the receipt ?
No , but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked .
Good afternoon . Reservations . May I help you ?
God ! It's freezing !
Crazy !
it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ?
Operator , can you give me any information on the call I just received ?
Is it because of the bad weather ? It's been really miserable for the past tew days .
Let's go there then . Is it a Chinese restaurant ?
What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
When does it start ?
Look ! they've taken your fur coat too .
That ' s true . But it ' s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv .
How long have you been feeling this way ?
Oh , let's hope so .
And that is ?
Are you going to take your children along ?
Good morning ! Welcome to our bank ! How may I help you ?

OK ! I'll show you how my mom did it .
I will . I want to write the first draft tonight . So I could bring it tomorrow morning .
Really ? Good for you .
Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ' s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning .
I am sorry to hear that . It shows that you should buy companies , not ideas .
That's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out .
Show me some of the latest fashion , please .
Yes . These were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you'll envy sardines in their cans .

One percent .

I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese .
Hi , Ellen ! How is it going ?
Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ?

Okay . I will begin working on it now , if you ' d like .
Sorry , we can ' t come down any more .
Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ?

Jim was late again .
Her home is between the China hotel and Li Sheng Theater .
Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings .
Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ?
I surely did ! Ask the customer service counter if we can deposit our stuff there .

It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ?
How did that happen ?
When will you be able to come here ?
I do . We haven't watered them for quite a few days .
Well , let me see . We have a nice one on which we still have several unfilled places .
So do you ! How are you doing ?
I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .
Yes . I will .
OK . Thank you very much for your trouble .
Thank you , I'll be there .
No , I ' Ve been waiting for ages .
Could I have your name again , please ?

I will check , please hold on . Sorry to say that flight is all booked up . Can I book you for the 3rd of September ?
... Okay , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card .
Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest . You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack .
This is exciting ! Thank you so much !
OK , OK . On one condition .
That'll be 120 dollars .
Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed .
do you know where the visa office is ?
Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ?
I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ?
Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke .
Coffee would be fine .
I absolutely love making mousaka , which is a Greek dish with eggplant . But it takes a lot of time , so I don ' t often make it .
But we cannot talk like elders .
Here's two twenties . Keep the change .
Of course . You'd better learn something about it .
Get on the bus heading west .
Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage .
All right . Maybe next time I can go with you . Bye !
For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops .
Where's Boston .
How many people have flung their hats into the ring ?
Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me ?
You will go back tomorrow , right ?
And a storm blew our roof away .
Look at the traffic . It ' s terrible !
Ok , so how about this , " This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! " .
I really did , but what ' s so great about it is that it ' s really affordable .
What about your computer skills ?
the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?
Oh , yes . I'll take this one . Can I pay by traveler ' s check ?
Were you around when the robbery happened ?
How awful , poor guy .
Well , yes . Actually , I'm going back to visit .
Of course . I made the apple pie this morning , so it ' s lovely and fresh .
Good morning , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ?
Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too .
I can make it for you if you like .
Me too . I get much more done when I am under the gun .
Certainly . May I have your name , please ?
Mr . Smith , this is your schedule .
You won ' t get anywhere that way . You ' re the one who needs to practice English , so you should make the first move . Besides , most American students are really friendly and outgoing . They will be glad to talk to you .
Sure , but how ?
Would you rather stay home ?
Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later .
What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today .
I think that they don ' t complete the forms correctly or they don ' t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful .
I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw .
You are right . Let ' s stop idling around and do something .
Well , you'd better take it out front .
We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard !
Good boy .
The charge was for a $ 350 purse , but I did not buy it .
Nice to see you , too .
You have worked in your present company for five years .
Ben , we ' re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ?
Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school .
What seems to be the problem , kid ?
Then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate .
I don't think I'm getting better .
My friend needed me to help him .
This one is the same size and color . But the design is different .
Well , as we say , the rest is history ...
What do you need to do ?
No , not really . Just bring yourselves . We would like to your presence .
The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m .
Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go .
In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better .
That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for !
It all depends on what you want to accomplish in your life .
Yes , that ' s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart .
3,000 marks in hundreds and the rest in tens and twenty ' s , please .
I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues .

I ' m sure we can work out some kind of deal .
There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .
I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ?
I'll give you cash .
It certainly sounds impressive . Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board ? We'll probably get back to you in a week .

Until Monday or Tuesday next week .

I think I can handle it by myself .
It's very exciting . I think .
Why don't you have any more money ?
I swear , I ' m going to kill you for this .
Good . I'm starving .
Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot .
That wouldn ' t be a lie !
You can deposit an initial amount of ten dollars .
We can ' t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .

Er ... Is it far from here ?
Don ' t use office phones for personal matters .
The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom . You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers .
Both the new paint and new carpet will be finished by next week .

16 divided by 2 equals 8 .
that's thoughtful of you .

That's right . Thank you .
Hello . I'd like to reconfirm my flight , please .
Excuse me , How do I get to the Grand hotel ?
thanks , sir .
Not always .

Do you have any tissue , Eve ? I've used all mine .
It wasn't too bad . Were you nervous ?
But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon .

Yes , actually I fell skiing last week and hit my head .
All right . I got it . What color is your car ?
Yes . Is it OK with you ?
that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners .
I think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car .
The ticket was for parking in the red zone .
The most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen .
Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
Come to my house this Sunday . My mom will not be at home then . We can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves !

I don't feel like going .
I'm here if you need any more help .
It ' s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .

Thank you for coming .
Tell me what you've been doing .
What else do we need ?
What's on the test ?
You must be joking !
That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage .
Football of course !
It's just around the comer . Would you need some pills ?
I really wish it wasn't so hot every day .
Why do you want to resign ?
Our terms are net 30 .
It's nice meeting you too , Alice .

I appreciate you telling me .
OK ! Let's go .
Sure . But you can only keep them for a week .
So you don't travel a lot now ?
yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ' ll envy sardines in their cans .
Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ?
I love children , as you know , so probably a children ' s charity .
It's more than I can afford . Can I make an offer ?
Fine . And you ?
Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight .
Yes . I also have a Loan Certificate .

I'm going to leave around 4 O'clock .
Hi , Bob , what time will you be home tonight ?
she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
No , you don't ! It's still beeping ! Come on , hand it over and I'll turn it off for you .
So did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon . it was raining cats and dogs .
He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't .
I think I have just a right apartment for you .
Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ?
I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say ?
Why do you always accuse me like that ?
All right . Come with me , please . Here is your seat , ma'am . Would you like to order now ?
I got it , but nevertheless . what I was saying just now was that how to terminate the contract before its term's up ?
You know how much I want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me . If I don't go to practise today . They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance .

Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .
I'm calling 6667777 . Maybe my finger slipped and I touched the wrong number .
Yes , It has . It went off 30 minutes ago .
when did it first break down ?
I don ' t know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
Of course I am . I only love you , Amy .
is it in a good location ?
No , it's too expensive for me . I've decided to take some exercises on my own .
I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ?
Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet .
Let's make a bet on who gets it .
Let me see . I'm sorry . Nothing's been turned in . Do you want to buy another one ?
Good afternoon , what can I do for you ?
Yeah . What's going on ?
What's your flight number ?
I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended .
It ' s about fifteen minutes ' walk . That ' s all .
I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man .
Did you land safely ?

How much in total ?
Hi , do you know what ' s for dinner ? I ' m starving .
May I ask your birth date ?
I can show you where they are .
It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .
Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it .
You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing .
I guess so . It was very terrible when she was at the onset of the illness . I am worried that I would lose her .
Hi , Rita , I ' m just looking for a pair of shoes . I won ' t be here for long .
Well , that ' s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .
did you end up losing any of your work ?
Kindergarten students usually only go to school for about four hours every day , but after that , they spend about eight hours in school every day .

I have a meeting this afternoon .
I can read the subtitles . My set is a huge-screen one .
I can't even imagine you snorkeling !
Thank you . Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I'm a stranger here .

Yes , how much is it ?
Which song ?
I am trying to call home .
I like what I see .
You need to get off on the corner of Del Mar and Hill .
How do we get to the library from here ?
Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ' Day . In Poland it ' s their independence day ! There ' s a lot going on around the world on this day .
I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
I'd better take the six thirty . It takes quite a while to get to the airport .
Mary's is handling it .
What made you decide to change your job ?
What do you think about her as a boss ?

How long will I take it to get there ?
It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ?
Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ?
Super . How long will I have to sit under the Hot Cap ?

I prefer the linen one .
For example , I have mastered Business English very well , and I also know a little Spanish .
You can just go to work after you vote .
That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool .
How do you celebrate it ?
I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop .
I don't know exactly , but it costs a lot of money .
I'm dead serious about this , Sally .
What did you enjoy the most ?
Wait for a moment . Mr . Bush . this is your bill , please sign your name here
They must . Let me look at that . Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth .
Oh , you read ? Very good . Then , I think we should do something different today . I'll give you some privilege .
We're catching most of our fish with lures .
Who knows ! That might come to later .
How does that fit , sir ?
What interests you in that type of music ?
I heard they used ultraviolet lamp to kill pests .
Ok . I will bring it with me .
Because there is a coupon for almost every product , we always bring coupons on our shopping trips .

I see
Here ' s your key . Check out time is 12 noon . If you want to stay until 6 p . m . , it ' s another half day . After that you have to pay for another night .
Really ? That ' s marvelous !
May I know the reason , madam ?
Did she tell you whether you would get the job ?
That ' s all right .
Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It's hard for kids to find out something like that .
I certainly do .
And I can experience another kind of life style .
it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes .
Well , I know you are interested in architecture , so you should't miss the Temple of Heaven , and the Great wall is a must too .
Does it cost money ?
Sorry , I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit . I wonder if you could help us to solve the problems .

How do you usually spend your time after work ?

You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us .
Have you got your visa yet ?
I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing .
What does MM / DD / YY mean ?
you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss !

She . She seems to be doing a pretty good job . Of course , anything would be better than that last guy !
Oh , I'll probably just stay at home .
Do you like watching TV ?
No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully .
What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ?
I want to change rooms immediately , plus a refund for tonight .
After you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor .
Are we going to have gym class tomorrow ?
I'm stuffed !
Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
Yeah . I met with them back in March , remember ?
Oh , I've no interest in such films .
What was that ?
They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today .
Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated !

No , I only receive my salary .
I have an idea .
I started with game show this morning , I really enjoy them , and even answered the most of questions correctly .
It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ?
Does this TV work well ?
Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within .

Be patient for just a few minutes , sir , and someone will be at your door .
What size , please ?
I'm afraid not ! Now this is just between you and me .

I've gotten about six .
What do you consider important when looking for a job ?
What number are you trying to dial ?
That's it , but will I be able to add more channels at another time ?
Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ?
The better you sand it , the better the finish will be .
Exactly !
Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life .
Oh , right . I suppose so . As long as you promise to lose !
do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
Do you have any direct flights to Toronto ?
We are busy in preparing for the train . Would you please buy us some fruit ?
I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !
But , sir , I didn't drink at all .
OK , see you then .
It's all right . Kids are like that .
Hi , Linda . I want to invite you to a dinner tomorrow evening .
When he pulled out the gun , I got so scared .
new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table .
Well , I don't have any cash with me , so I ' ll have to put it on credit .
Who's Brad ?
No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent .
But we could just stay there for 20 minutes .
Who else will come ?
sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ?
Yeah , let's do so .
Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today .
Sellers aren ' t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken .

Very nice . He gets along with his classmates very well .
I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ?
We really want to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat .

You're spending a very long time on my hair .
No way . It ' s her who should apologize .

We ate everything from dinner .
Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now .
Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report .
It's all in the bag .
Yes it is . Thank you .
Thanks a lot . Have a nice day .
A large , with tons of ketchup .

Actually , I need two calls , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen .

I'll try all of those . How do you know so much about International food ?
Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? !
I'm sick of it , too .
thanks . Who much would that come to ?
How did the business trip go ?
It ' s that way , on the second floor .
Shall we check your oil and tires ?
It sounds good . I'll take that .
I would like to come in at three o'clock .
When's the last time you took your tablets ?
You ' re welcome . I hope your wife is feeling better soon .
You're going to make me rich by not paying me ?

We can make a number of mixed drinks at our bar .
I will cancel the fees you owe .

Yes , if I were hired , when would you like me to start ?
Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ?
Yeah , it'll take us there .
Does the rate include the cost of gas ?
No , I'm strictly a spectator . I just like watching skating . It's so beautiful .
Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ?
I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again .
I guess I'm lending them to you ...
Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name .
You ' re welcome . Good-Bye .
Good morning , Madam ! Can I help you ?
You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
I can assist you .
Yes . See you then .
You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted .
Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ?

That of the old man .
Why did you decide to apply for this position ?
Thanks . I really appreciate it . In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship .
I ' m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up .
Excuse me , Miss . What did the announcement say ?
Just look at the screen here . It'll give you prompts , you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it .
I hope I still have chances .
And after that ?
it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now .
Well , just because it's you . Tomorrow , say around noon .
Me , too . At this time of the year , I often miss my home in the warm south .
What do you usually do in your work time ?
Don ' t put me on the spot . You know , I can ' t do that .
Oh , I see . What makes you think that ?
Where are you going , Jane ?
Would you like some more rice ?
I wouldn't like to hold a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
I'm sorry , Mr . Lee . Egg tarts are food too . We will have to confiscate these .
what is the purpose of your stay ?
Poor fellow ! What's the date today , buddy ?
Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price . On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .

I know . Do you have some change I can borrow ?
Would you like to mail it by air or sea ?
Do you know what time it is ?
Joan is a thorough drag !
The vegetables seem to not be very fresh .
Do you have a Chinese edition of this ?
That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders .
Yes , I'm looking for a house .
Um ... no .
Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this .
I will be sending the assistant manager to check it out . May we look at it this morning ?

Welcome back .

I just don't trust you any more .
What about grapes and water melons ?
Did you see the woman that just left my office ?
How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe !
Look at my eyes .
Good afternoon . It ' s very nice to see you again .

You are under arrest , sir . You have the right to remain silent . You better not pout , you better not cry . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to an attorney , if you cannot afford one , the state will appoint one for you .

I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ?
You're my hero .
No , thanks . But I'd like a facial massage .

OK , that ' s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
What about the insurance and housing policies ?
256MB .
I don ' t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that .

Does she live nearby ?
It's me , sir . But I am sorry I have forgotten to prepare for it .
How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ?
I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes .
Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so .
I see . Including bonus ?
Ten sheets of rice paper , 25 brushes , two boxes of oil color and two boxes of water color . All these come up to $ 35 . 50 , sir .
So what are you interested in ?
More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ?
Where did you find this apartment ?
Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence .
Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .
I want to buy a skirt , but I have no idea which one to buy .
No . It's no problem . Are you American ?
Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ?
That ' s my final offer . Take it or leave it .
He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood .
I had no idea that bus went to the station .
Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates .
Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
Um . Ten ?
I'm already dialing , sir .
Have you forgotten the cheers ?
Just did my best .
Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not .
I understand , Mr . Carmichael . I ' d be glad to make it some time next week .
of course . The fitting room is right over there .
They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old .
You haven't lost any weight , have you ?
In April or early May .
Alright . That's a good idea .
No , it's not far . It's near our old house .
I know , darling . But I do have a lot of work to do , hope you can understand me .
Yes , I'm calling from Tenga Company . I'd like to know if you have rooms available for the nights from October 8 to October 12 . We are going to have a business conference .
This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink .
Yes , Let ' s .
Hold the line , please . Mr Wood is in the meeting with managing director at the moment I afraid . Can I help you ?
We are now walking on what is in fact an island . Here we get one of the 10 sceneries of the West Lake , Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake .
I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school .
Don't worry ; I'm sure it will be fine . If I do have any queries I'll call you , OK ?
Are you having any luck ?
I am afraid I am not interested in fashion .
Hi Colin . How are you feeling today ?
The usual minimum purchase is 5,000 RIB .
Sure . What's up ?
Forget it . Good luck . I hope you can make it .
That ' s right . That ' s one reason why it ' s so important to protect every species .
Beautiful .
I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology .
Excuse me , is there a table for 8 right now ?
Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started .
They're available anytime between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m . , seven days a week .
The man behind your mother must be your elder brother .
I'm a student , and I have a part-time job , too .
Wow , your apartment is a mess .
By the way , do you work out ?
What time is it , please ?
Do you get along well with each other ?
Yes , maybe I should have another try .
Good . Now exactly where is it ?
Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ?
You get five paid sick days .
Thank you very much ! And then what ?
Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ?
Yeah , because he just killed a man in cold blood .
Good afternoon .
Your food will be brought to you momentarily . I hope you enjoy it .
I ' ll be right over !
Sure . What kind of apartment are you looking for ?
What are your plans now that you ' re getting out ?
Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ?
Then try it yourself .
That's fine . Then let's sign a contract .
I ' ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ?
We do not want you to sign any documents that you do not understand . You may get assistance with any questions that you have .
Wow ! She's gorgeous .
OK ! I'll call security .
Here is your receipt . Thank you .
I would like to purchase it .
I often feel so tired .
Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat !
After you ' Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it .
What separates your product from the competition ?
Which class are you working on right now ?

It starts at $ 30,000 . S
What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ?
I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something .
I know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . So , thank you .
I have a severe headache now .
buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses .
I ' m afraid not .
Yes . Here's my identification .
I am glad to inform you that you are expected to come for an interview in our head office tomorrow .
I want to say goodbye . I ' m leaving for America tomorrow .
Mr . : That's alright . It's the first day of school , after all .
Do you think any studios will open up soon ?
Yes , this mattress is very good . It's pretty firm . The mattress I ' m now sleeping on is saggy .
Yeah . I'm still hungry , but I guess it's kind of rude to keep eating while he's talking , huh ?
Would you like something to drink ?
Yes . But I am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer .
All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
How did he make a fortune ?
There really are not many side effects . You need to drink a lot of water when you take this pill .
I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !
Yes . First , you need to turn around . Do you remember passing some traffic lights further up this road ?
Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ' s take a look at this tricky section .
Why would anyone vote for McCain ?
The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .
Sure , I used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time .
Banker ?
Ya , they do . Anyone else come to mind ?
Can you pass me a menu please .
Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ?
How long does the tour take ?
OK , so do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?
It's 687 3452 .
So long . Thank you for shopping here .
No , I haven't . Is the food good there ?
You ' re home late today , David . How was school ?
Why would you park in the red zone ?
But I don't know what I would do .
I'm taking two weeks now . but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter .
Let me ring you up . Okay , sign here , please .
What happens if I am not satisfied with my purchases ?
I can tell you what bus to catch , but you have to walk a little bit .
How can you be so sure ? You haven ' t been together with her , have you ?
I ' m afraid I never go for a holiday . It ' s always business .
How many best friends do you have ?
Did you have fun there ?
So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it .
Thank you , I really do appreciate that .
Sure . You can review the lessons you have learned at school and learn something new there .
I'm a foreigner here . My English isn't perfect . Can you tell me what satin is ?
No , I am not . And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me .
Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing .
What about next saturday .
No , we met at university .
Why does the government levy the tariff ?
I've got them .
That ' s when the masseuse walks on your back and massages you with her feet .
So you are interested in being with a company for the long term ?
Wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater .
I think a pipe burst in my apartment .
Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ?
It takes about half an hour to get there .
She ' s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ' s putting it ... OK .
Why don ' t you help me save money ? You are always spending money .
I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place .
Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor .
Yes , stones .
Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .
Yes , I have purposefully done some homework in advance .
At the Gate .
Perhaps I'd better ring the police ...
Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ?
I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann .
Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ?
I enjoy listening to both Rock and R & B .
She's very fond of detective stories .
When do they arrive in Beijing ?
Man , they take a lot of our paycheck .
Where did he go ?
Do you know when people began to sing the song " Happy Birthday " ?
They look great ! Hey , are you hungry ? I know a good Ethiopian restaurant-Meskerem .
I spent it on a bag of chips .
Guess what ? I won the speech contest at my school .
So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ?
Yes , I'm afraid you will . Altogether on the watch and the perfume you owe me seven pounds .
Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does .
Yes , I was .
Here you are . Thank you , bye-bye !
I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well .
I think you ' re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem .
It doesn ' t make any difference to me .
Is that serious , doctor ?
Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview .
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end .
He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ?
I agree . Buses bounce too much . After two or three hours , you feel too tired .
Keep walking and look for a tall building .
I know . Did your mom double check on the church reservations ?
Is it ready to eat ?
Thanks !
But I just want to give her some tips .
30 dollars , ma'am .
Well , for a monthly pass , it'll cost you $ 65 .
We'll be delayed for one hour , because the airport is very crowded .
Then , pass me a bowl for the soup .
What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ?
If you want to speed up your system , you ' Ve got to clean it up first .
I am really excited to be taking this workshop so that I can get ready for my interview next week .
How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful .
Yes , I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole .
Yeah . I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free .
Fortunately , there is no person died .
Not at all . I ' ll be glad to do it .
Eat humble pie ? Impossible , I ' Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him .
Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
I couldn ' t find the book I was looking for .
Next Monday morning .
Yes , please , thank you .
I have a Canon SLR .
No , but she gave me her friend's telephone number . I can call him and make an appointment .
Goodbye . Hope to see you again .
Ii is distinguished for the strength of law and foreign languages studies ..
Bring us a bottle of Remy Martini and red wine .
I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing .
Things doing great ! It ' s funny running into you like this . Smell well , just last week I ran into Matt as well .
Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun .
Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ?
Very agreeable , Mr . Smith . It will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you .
One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more .
How about the Yellow Mountains ?
Excuse me , sir . What can I do for you ?
OK , that will be OK .
How are you , Mr . Stone ? I m Farley .
Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage .
Let ' s fix it at seven o'clock , OK ?
We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival .
There ' s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company located there .
He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means .
And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ...
How much would you say ?
OK . Make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade . Why is there oil all over the floor ?
I swear I never drink again . Just give me another chance , please .
How fine the needlework is ! What's the price ?
Shall we go out tonight ?
How much are you asking for this ?
yes , I've been to Tailband , Egypt , and Japan .
First please get the bill at the doctor's office , then pay it either with cash or by check . Even though you're discharged , you still need to take a rest at home . Don't hurry back to work until you have fully recovered .
Great . That's my favorite seat which will be the nearest to the birthday cake .
yeah . I found it is so close to our life .
What would be the best time for you to help me ?
Show me your torgue . What did you eat yesterday ?
I preferred working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can ' t do without them .
Haha ... You are not very funny . I guess that means - - except me to tell my lover we have stoped seeing each other too .
Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening .
Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person !
What kind of movie is it ? I don ' t like many of his movies , actually .
Yes . Are you in his class ?
my boss .
I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ?
I think it's going to be a nice day .
I'm going to the United Stated to attend my daughter's commencement .
Here , take my credit card .
I'm number seven . What about you ?
Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
It's still early .
Yes , we also apply a special day cream that protect the skin from the sun and the night cream that moisturize to the skin .
No , I don't have a ride yet .
Great . I'll wait right here , thanks .
Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
Ok . I ' Ve finished online . Let ' s go . I ' ll just get some money and my credit card .
Well . I ' m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good .
Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming .
You should throw some corn on the grill .
I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then .
Then my son drove into a tree .
Checking out time is twelve . Guests will avoid an additional days room charge by checking out on time .
John passed away .
A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch , OK ?
I'm sorry . I forget all about it .
Good luck next time .
That's too bad . I wish your mother can recover soon .
Honey , where did you buy this skirt ?
They may have some difficulty in doing it .
I think the gears have seized up
How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong .
Is there anything I can do ?
No , that ' s not true . I ' Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ' s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants .
A nice name , isn't it ?
They usually do .
It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now .
Can you help me pick out a gift for my daughter ?
I passed history test .
So how long does it take ?
Check out these wheels !
I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too .
What was you G . P . A ?
I know . One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them . They are being smuggled in by the thousands .
The view is breathtaking .
Thanks for the offer , but I think I've got it . Hopefully , I won't get lost again on my way there !
What time do you go to work ?
Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon .
Yes , I want a pair of sport shoes , Jordan .
I don ' t have health insurance .
Did you order the cake ?
I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others .
All right . I accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton FOB stowed . The other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . Now will you draft the agreement or shall I ?
My sister . She is going to her in-law's house this year .
Thanks a lot . I hope to see you again .
I like horror movies because I like to be scared .
Mrs . Lee , I ' Ve stayed here for almost a week . And I really must leave tomorrow .
Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays .
All right . I have a registered then .
It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 .
I am calling to apply to work in your agency of entry .
Do I have to pay for electricity myself ?
I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally .
That's too bad , but the porterhouse will be okay .
that ' s right . You ' re going away next week .
Make sure they are fresh .
That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines .
I agree . It makes it difficult to breathe .
Here is your boarding pass . Have a nice day .
What channel did you watch last night ?
That's true . Here are some samples of hairstyles . What do you think about this one ?
Maybe we ' ll meet some of the artists too .
The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ' ll consider giving you a better discount .
I will talk about developing sales through our website . All the branch heads will be there , and most of the staff .
Yes , we have a nice room on the sixth floor .
I know and they are really nice , too .
If it is not more than fourteen days past its due date , then you may still mail it in .
Maybe I just shouldn ' t show the income then .
I have to make money to support the family , so I have little time left to share with you .
Will you ever get another copy ?
Not bad , thanks .
Well . What's this 138 dollars charge then ?
I have got a computer engineer's qualification certificate .
Sure . Sounds great . Let's go .
I'll plan for the vacation .
Thanks , ma ' am . You ' re a lifesaver !
I will tell you ahead of time , that there is a lot to sign here , but I will help you every step of the way .
The problem is that I have no idea . I didn't pay attention .
She looks very beautiful . She is a nice girl .
sure , have a seat .
But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .
Hello , Mr Peng , how nice to hear from you again . What can I do for you today ?
Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ?
Maybe . I don't know .
Will you show me your key card , please ?
That's $ 50 for a single night .
No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ?
Do you know anything about health food ?
She looks very healthy . How old is she ?
Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .
Is it the rush hour ?
Thank you for saying . I think you are light on your toes too . Oh , the music starts again , would you like to have another dance , miss ?
What will I learn when I see the results on the website ?
Your change , please .
Something like a passport .
She looked sweeter than her pictures .
First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ?
He's an old antique , very serious .
It is quite important for all of us . Without clear goals , one may lose direction and cannot pave the way for their future .
How much would you like to spend ?
Can I see your license , please ?
Alison , would you like to have some more ?
Pardon ?
What do you do for work ?
Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
7:00 , sir .
Thank you miss ... Wang . I'm Bob Jones and I'll be handling your application .
Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?
I will call the owners right now . They will be happy to hear the good news .
Whole Foods is way better than Sons , trust me .
Yes , of course . Thank you very much .
Ok . Let ' s get to work on our advertising campaign .
I came in to see how my home inspection went .
I must make an apology for losing my temper .
I ' Ve got some bad news . All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected . We ' re going to have to start from scratch .
Thank you , that will be all . I ' ll take care of it .
Its already very cheap . Let's make it 6 000 yuan .
Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ?
No . Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well .
Your desire coincides with ours .
No , I'm an art lover , so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli !
Well , please give me a first class ticket .
Very good , thanks .
When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead .
Yes , I want to deposit 1000 Yuan in my bank account .
Take my VISA .
I thought a university was for studying .
I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right .
Good afternoon . madam . How can I help you ?
What will your major be ?
Would you like me to tell you where I got mine .
Oh , yes , Mr Wang , i look at your resume you emailed , very impressive , are you a P . M . ~ meet someone like you , i was thinking of calling you this afternoon , and having a telephone interview .
Could I have the check , please ?
I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it .
This is Li with Silk Company . We met last Sunday during the exhibition .
What problems are you having exactly ?
Do you have magazines now ?
I feel that people can love who they want .
Would you mail a letter for me ? My hands are full .
Then you've heard from Vital ?
Sorry about that .
505 .
Do you work there ? I have an interview today with Dale Mendoza . Do you know her ?
Why are you applying for a visa ?
There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ?
I don't like shopping in malls . I like shopping on the street . There is more variety .
Let's drive off this road .
Just leave the stuff by the curb . The company ' ll send a guy out next month to give you the bill .
The apple crisp sounds great .
How do you use a public phone ?
Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites .
I can ' t right now .
Hello Mr Janus . What can we do for you today ?
That's just over there . On the right .
So , you ' re online eight hours a day .
There isn't much rice , is there ?
camping for an evening is ok , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night !
Thanks . What time will you arrive ?
Hm .. I think you ' Ve got the flu .
I ' d like to have this cashed , please .
I am new to this school and not familiar with this library . Can you help me ?
I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage .
What shall we do after the volleyball match ?
Actually , I received that kind of training when I was in college .
Be quiet , Will you ?
What's the weather like there today ?
I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ?
Yes , it is . It ' s also very different from the British education system .
Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ' ll be more sorrow .
I ' m not going to be able to vote this Tuesday .
Shall I make some coffee , Jane ?
Yeah , the scenery is beautiful . What's more , the air is fresh here ?
I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?
Some days are just like that .
Can I pay at the check-in desk when I pick up my ticket ?
Do you need money or what ?
You are kidding .
Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place .
Promise ?
Well , I don't have an Ethernet port . My computer runs entirely on wireless service .
Where it is ?
I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ?
I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life .
Good heavens . Why did you take so many ?
It's my pleasure . Actually , it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different . As for myself , I'd like to recommend gin and tonic .
We'll try to arrange it but I can't guarantee , sir .
no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !
Is she short ?
I was in the Law School in Harvard University .
I don't know . Where ?
when are you going to give me those brochures ?
Are you introverted or extroverted ?
What kind of girl is she ?
Yes , that'll be all right . Well , please tell me about your working experience .
What kind of warrant ?
How about taking a walk in the park ?
I'll cook dinner for you .
Is that so ? Well , what kind of bait are you using ?
Excuse me , what's this item for ?
I don't like anything about it .
I noticed there ' s a jam a few blocks away .
I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her .
I ' m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ?
Do you have to walk a cat ?
You ' ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year .
That ' s not going to happen .
Okay . I won ' t hold you up then .
That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ?
Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back .
What's the gate number ?
One of the questions they ask you is if you were well enough to work .
I won ' t go any lower than $ 1050 .
No . Forget about it . It's not important .
You sit in there , listen to the morning announcement with other kids , and then you go to your classes .
It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ?
I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
I can ' t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ' s no laughing matter .
I want to buy a pair of shoes for an interview .
Oh , there are many Chinese antique stores . They get paintings , too . Do you get interested in them ?
But how will I get to know the products ?
And then what happened ?
Nothing much . I ' m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ' s all I have planned .
I have been a Production Manager .
Very well , thank you . I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve . Would you care to join us ?
For two weeks . After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old .
Sure ?
Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can .
It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .
Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job .

I haven't seen Bill lately . How is he ?
What's my other option ?
You've take the words out of my mouth .

That ' s a lovely hat .
What color is her hair ?
Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off .
let me think . You could get an Indian or Thai vegetable curry , or you could get some Kimchi .
Please come to the front to have five minutes ' free talk in English . Very well ! Whose turn is it to have a free talk ?
I've just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much .
I'm glad you feel that way . We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ?
Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment .
Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ?
I don't know , Doctor . I'm ill . I have a headache and a stomachache .
Sure , we do .
Maybe we could get some new furniture . Better stuff .
It's fine . Please wrap it .
I think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn .
Yes , I like the old style dance , such as waltz ,  rumba and so on . They are quite graceful .
what a shame !
Well , did you get any honors or rewards in college ?
I'm afraid it would take 15 minutes at most .
Mary , how was your date with John ?
I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .
Certainly , Mr . Baker .
How ' s your boy , Jack ?
It's beautiful 75 degrees .
My old man does not allow me to go back later than 11 p . m . Bye !
Excuse me , do you sell apples ?
Didn ' t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ' t he ?
If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ?
What ? What happened ?
Yes , unfortunately . I'm very much subject to it .
No , she's out for lunch . May I take a message ?
Then we'd better go back to our cabin .
Are you going to ship this by air ? That might cost a little more .
Sure , just a second . Who ' s calling ?
That sounds good . How are you doing , Linda ?
Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ' s a real bargain .
4 days .
Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ' m not interested in detective novels .
This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .
You didn't know ?
Pork . Where's the meat counter ?
You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ?
Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier !
I don't know the words .
Haven't been sleeping well recently .
Excuse me , can you tell me how to apply for a visa to America ?
I'll have a cup of tea .
Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on .
That depends on the day . We sell from here and on the Internet . I would say about twenty to thirty per week .
Well , since it's summer and it looks like you've had quite a bit of sun , I'd recommend our summer special . It's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin .
Yes , it does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too .
Yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ' s cheaper .
Nothing of that sort !
I suppose . And What about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?
I'd like to get a BA , but I don't know where I should go .
Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze !
The headmaster asked them not to do so .
In Boston .
Of course I did . I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up . But unfortunately , I didn ' t realize it .
I can ' t believe it ! I guess I ' ll be here until ten again tonight !
Don ' t worry about it . I have his pager number right here .
All right . But so help me it's a better work .
Hello , Shogun Restaurant .
It ' s on sale this week .
You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form .
You ' re new here , right ?
Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity .
I came to this lab to have my blood drawn .
Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday .
Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted !
What starting salary would you expect here ?
Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory .
Just don't come looking to me for help .
No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
Don't be scared . Bite the bullet and everything will be right again .
Your document will be ready in about ten minutes .
Will I get notification that I qualify for unemployment ?
You pay when you pick them up . I don't need a deposit for just one roll of film .
Do you have a statement for your debit card ?
Excuse me . Can you show me some nail-polish ?
Fine , it's the thing for me . I will take it .
I ' d really rather not . I ' ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ' t afford !
I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word .
It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers .
This place doesn't look like Altadena .
With the greatest pleasure ! Where is the concert held this evening ?
Spring will come soon . And we will have some pleasant weather then .
I am sorry for that . We will improve the dishes next time .
Furnished .
His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down .
Yes , we finished the evaluation of it . If the price is acceptable we would like to order now .
From tomorrow till January 8th . That's five days in all .
A visitor .
That's not enough . You have many other things to prepare .
I'm going to get a Snickers or a Kit Kat .
OK ! Here you go .
Your order will be ready soon , thank you for calling .
Oh , Paul is very easy-going and friendly .
No , not yet , but someone ' s going to have to .
Woo , easy .
What are you doing , Victor ?
Sorry , what was your last name again ?
I wouldn ' t be able to make it without your help .
Yes . There's one on the corner of 23th street .
Seriously , it looks really nice on you . Where did you buy it from ?
I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ' t it ?
The man with his hair cropped .
Thanks . But I know falling in love is one thing , while staying in love is another .
Sorry , you're right . I think you'll be a good politician .
I've never met Darren . But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable .
I'll pay cash .
That ' s a good idea . I ' ll look into finding something like that .
You really have to ?
May I know your full name ?
No . It ' s Swedish . Would you like me to demonstrate it for you ?
All right , sir .
Well , as the saying goes -- we aim to please !
I'll let you off with a warning .
Can you fill out this form then ?
Look ! This window is open .
My computer isn ' t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ?
You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog .
Jack Bates .
No , I don't think I need to do that .
Yeah . This is a clever way to be in contact with such a person .
I like them . Do you have matching belts ?
Sure . Wait for a moment . Here you are .
You are not the gray train , I guess . But bite the bullet and you'll soon be in the chips again .
Congratulations . How is your wife doing ?
Oh , I'm sorry . Here's the lid . Yes , it comes with the pan .
No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ?
Okay , I want to change 22,000 .
Of course . I'm sorry for your daughter .
Fine . If you do end up going somewhere , we can just use our pass key .
I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
Here is my friend Bob .
Beautiful weather , isn ' t it ?
Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines .
Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
Take care of yourself and remember to keep in touch .
Hey , Ann . Wake up . It's time to get out of bed .
Hello , Could you please connect me to Mr . Cook's office ? It is on Line Three .
We will be there ! Thanks for the help !
Mom ! How can I help with the washing up ?
Yes , I packed my books in it . Thank you .
Yeah , I make certain . A half-price ticket cuts us one point five Yuan .
I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult .
I'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece . Is that all right ?
You can call the Employment Development Office and request a form .
Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ' s not hard . I can do that .
Where do you wish me to take you , sir ?
I have a terrible headache .
Here is your bill . It totals 3250 dollars .
Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets .
I'll get the first aid box . There's some antiseptic cream and a bandage in there .
It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to . It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone !
Then does it go well with my sweater ?
I think I can commute that far without any trouble .
How are you doing today ? How many in your book today ?
I ' m Jack . What ' s your name ?
About nine thirty in the morning .
You really don ' t need to .
So are you .
Yes . I hope you can help . I'm interested in obtaining a Working Capital Loan . So , I was wondering what you offer here ? Do you have various types ?
That ' s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ' t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
Even in the winter ?
OK , sir . We offer two types of lunch , Chinese food and western food . Which one would you prefer ?
Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world .
I'm having a great time . I love it . I'm glad we came .
I agree with you .
Okay . Just stay in your car . We ' ll be there in five minutes .
O . K . Thanks . I ' ll let you know what I find .
Have you received any honors ?
Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics .
Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ?
I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along .
Yes . We can put it in our storage room .
I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ?
Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first .
I want to help with both .
Do you miss your family ?
The problem is that many poor people might suffer .
Well , I ' m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors .
That sounds delicious .
most people are working Friday night , so it's going to start around 9 pm .
Excuse me , I'm lost . Can you show me where I am in this map ?
Don ' t worry about them . They ' re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ' s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ?
I have some tablets for seasickness .
Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd .
How do you mean " suffer " ?
IMPF Bank , Li Lan speaking , how may I help you ?
I think that many physicians now agree with that idea .
This isn't fair .
I see . I'd like to live here for about three years .
You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith .
What color would you prefer ?
Please wait a moment , Mr . Black . I'll have to check the reservation records ... I'm sorry , but we are expecting several tour groups to arrive today . They have booked all the rooms on the 10th floor .
Yes , in the Chinese style .
Come on . Let's split the difference , 15 % .
Not at all . A party is a party . I ' ll be happy to come .
Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing .
It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you've had to wait .
What do I do next ?
thank you . goodbye .
No , I don ' t really like it . It ' s boring .
Could you please go lower ?
How about your communication skills ?
Okay . How much ?
Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first .
I see . After all , he's boss's son .
I ' Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ' m sure we ' ll get on well together .
I'm not sure what kind that I want .
Awesome !
We ' ll send someone right up . But don ' t worry about that . Maybe the service person forgot to do it .
Yeah , that's nice .
Do you have the notes from last week's class ?
My pleasure . Take care and have a nice trip .
Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ?
You ' re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself . At that time we didn ' t have a good English studying environment . I have to keep my dictionary on hand .
You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep .
Absolutely . Take my word for it .
How have you been treating it ?
Chicken soup again ?
How is your new car ?
I ' m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later .
They will tell you the aid is impossible .
Are you finished ?
Yes , or you'll be late .
Oh yeah ?
You'll find some of those here , too . But not if you don't shake it up ! There's an African saying , " If you can talk , you can sing ! If you can walk , you can dance ! "
What you're paying for , Ma'am , are the ingredients . It is a very high quality product .
No strawberries . We'll charge your amenities account , if that's okay .
Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up .
Sorry to bother you , but do you have change for a one ?
No . It's on me this time .
Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
We certainly do . May I ask you the purpose of the rental ?
She ' s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too .
That ' s true . We had an argument yesterday . She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner .
Yes , I have two large suitcases and one box .
He was by himself .
Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ?
You ' re right . It is . Let me have a look . I have 419 . 6 RIB . is that enough ?
Yes , is there any vacant room for tomorrow ?
Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ?
That sounds like a good idea . Where should I go to eat that ?
I'd like to buy a pair of leather shoes .
Is that so ? I didn't know it . Can I possible borrow a jacket and a tie ?
I live here . I was invited by George-he's the tall guy over there . He looks a bit drunk , actually ...
well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret .
Oh , no ...
That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated .
If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love .
I bet it's May 5th .
Dad , where are we off to ?
What were the results of the game ?
Well , it's here now . Shall we credit that straight to your account ?
I have no problem singing like a canary .
How would you like your hair cut ?
Great . I ' ll have a shot .
Even though I really like it , it's just too modern for me .
Well , I hope you ' ll feel better soon .
Yes . I dare say it will be .
Yes , but I need the report copied on transparency paper .
I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ' t far away .
You like that work ?
I have a sweet tooth . Chocolate is my favorite . So how about you ?
I'm not sure , but let me check my schedule ... Ah , no . I have nothing then .
Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long .
What's the weight limit ?
I know what you mean , Carol . I ' Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ' s supposed to be easy !
I think someone is stalking me .
We've a country house .
Help ! Help !
Marry ; Mr . Johnson wants these documents to be copied .
What are they ?
Have you used any hotel services this morning ?
Looks like the TV wins that argument .
I can hardly make ends meet these days .
Most of them in this store are from Mexico .
I'd like to sit in the rear .
You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words .
Harry . He has been assisting me on the plan .
Thanks . See you at five . Don ' t forget to bring your valentine .
This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows .
The operation was very successful .
She did ? Why didn't anyone tell me ?
Oh don ' t worry , I ' ll be fine .
It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own .
We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them . We'll also go to church and pray .
I like science most .
I'll charge it . Here's my card .
Eighteen .
Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
I guess so , but I think it ' s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes .
What did you think you were doing ?
I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go , so don ' t provoke him .
Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry .
Sometimes you can't win for losing , sir .
Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ?
Well , your qualifications for the job are excellent . And is there anything you'd like to ask about the job ?
My vote is my own private business .
I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
What was wrong ?
How come you don ' t have all of his films on DVD ?
I ' m sure you have chances everywhere . You ' re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular .
You are right . Did you say 5:30 ? I'll make a note of it . Fine .
But isn't it the same with wiki ?
Where shall we go on vacation this summer ?
Can you help me , please ? Is there a public restroom near here ?
I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ?
I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius .
Hi , Tina , I've got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising .
Hmm . . . well , maybe we can buy this one then .
Can I get a relaxer , too ? And why did you say , " You crazy " instead of " You ou're crazy " ?
We are all very proud of you .
thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place .
I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form .
Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good .
What do you mean it should ?
You look really wiped out .
Thanks , but I don't want to put you into any trouble .
It is because of the quality .
Yes , madam , I agree . What size are you ?
Sounds good . Thanks for your help .
Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help .
So we can add her tip of $ 7 . 20 to the bill of $ 36 . 00 and the total will be $ 43 . 20 .
No . Thanks for reminding me .
Which child is this ?
There aren't many clothes , is your load big ?
Tina , you should have more nutritious food . Don ' t eat these crisps any more .
What a nice theatre ! I guess it can seat hundreds of people .
It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English .
Steve , I was born ready ! I ' m going to blow you guys off the treadmill today .
Sure ! It's txyb@gmail . com .
Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms .
Well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery .
Make sure to remind me right before you are absent .
Aren't there any trains before 10:30 ?
I'm sure he was off-side .
Yes , we are .
It's a little like being a mom , only I get paid for it !
For what time ?
Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain .
Front Desk . What can I do for you ?
then SOHO is your ideal work style .
I hope you enjoyed your stay , sir .
She ' s your mother !
Verry sorry to have kept you waiting so long . What do you want , Madam ?
How much does a mango cost ?
You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening .
Harris and Anne are perfect for each other .
Why are you always so mean ?
Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
What are the seasons like in your city ?
For how many people
We are all going to have great interviews . What are some things that we need to remember in an interview ?
Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week !
But it's a good opportunity to learn French .
I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ' m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people .
Do you allow any commission ?
I will let her know where you are .
So it is no wonder people cannot keep faith with it .
It's made from naturally frozen grapes .
But it's quite convenient for you to go to any part of the city . The subway is nearby .
I don't know what we need .
Are you still busy today ?
Yeah , my name is like N-A-N-J-U .
I wonder what we should have for dinner this evening ?
Well , I am kind of broke .
Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie .
Yeah , you are right !
I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed .
Sunny side up , please .
Very romantic .
I guess so . I don ' t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ?
Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ?
Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB .
Well , I'm an English major , you know . So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things .
How long does the tour last ?
A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question .
Our total for dinner is $ 36 . 00 .
was it very old house ?
Hi , Juliet , I'm treating Mr . Li and his team members from Galp to dinner tomorrow evening . Where do you think I should take them ?
What's this ? Essential oil ? Wow ! This stuff is expensive .
I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point .
I ' m sorry to hear that . Take care of yourself .
What ? I sent you three or four messages !
That ' s right . I ' Ve never really liked it since I got here .
That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away .
That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ?
The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues .
Your employer can tell you if you have been paying into unemployment and now qualify to collect .
Very useful advice , I will try them right now .
I'll look out for you about 2 tomorrow afternoon .
Oh , I get it . My email address is bluedog123@yahoo . com .
But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me !
No , I hope not . I want to have a deck chair and enjoy the crossing .
I am sorry to hear that you are not feeling well . How are you ?
Because you can see the results with the general public ?
Do you know how happy I am ? The Ant Kingdom is a perfect world with colorful fairy tales . It seems like the air is fresh here .
For me , the times of chatting online has gone .
What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us .
OK . See you at noon .
Give it to me . I need to use it .
Thanks doc !
Can I help you ?
How long it will take by sea ?
Hi , my name ' s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door .
Oh , I wonder if she ' ll go for that .
If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars .
Do you have any hobbies ?
From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character .
Then you apply the varnish , which is very easy . It is like painting .
No I'm afraid not . I'm meeting Ruth then . How about the fourteenth in the morning ?
I'm still a student .
Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ?
Can you point out your mother for me ?
here you go .
I'm sorry . I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then .
Ok , I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies .
He did ? That's too bad !
Yes , where's the meat counter ?
I want to travel to the ancient town in the south of China . Would you please tell me something about it ?
Did the police find who did it ?
I meant that they're very simple , easy to talk to .
Thanks a lot . By the way , please call a taxi for me .
How about seconds , Victor ?
Um .. I don ' t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother .
Will you apologize to her ?
3 dollars .
That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time .
Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ?
I'm used to this kind of days .
That ' s great to hear .
When can I see it ?
You mean 30 push-ups ?
Yeah , some places are very short of water .
Yeah . He has no one to count on .
I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you .
So , how'd everyone do ?
There're traffic jam everywhere this hour of the day !
Yes , certainly . I'll be back in a minute . Here you are
That will do . Where shall I go to pay the money ?
Could you please help me put my bags in the truck ?
Would you please reconsider ?
You hit the nail right on the head .
You are a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hot pot ?
Let's go to the coffee shop then . It's quiet there .
The mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos . If only we could be that thin then ...
Well , who is your favorite football player ?
We have a team to make itineraries of the tour , evaluate the value of it for one tourist and recommend the routine for different tourists .
I ' d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me .
Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop .
Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ?
Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system .
Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer .
Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ' t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one !
Good . That would be very helpful . Can you start with those pages over there ?
Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter .

Really , it was nothing .

Not bad , thanks ! Our company has sent me to pick you up here .
My bumper is smashed in .
Hello . Gail Willows speaking .
It's a job I've been dreaming of since I was very little . I firmly believe that teaching is one of the most honorable jobs in the world .
August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ?
Can you call the owners with my acceptance right away ?
Yes , we really enjoyed it .
I ' m so sorry to hear that .
What kind of benefits are we talking about ?
Why do you plan to change your job ?
I can tell you what kind I like .
Once you get to Fair Oaks and Washington , get off .
Well . I will tell you what , Mr . Li . I will review the contract and talk with management . Then we will get together and hash this out .
Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do .
He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business .
Good afternoon , what can I do for you today ?
Look at what you have done . All thumbs .
Looks like a lucky day for everyone .
I'd like to see it for myself .
You're smart .
Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us .
I didn ' t get in .
If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money .
Well , your making cinnamon toast inspired me to go out and buy a waffle maker .
well , I still can ' t adjust to the fast pace of city life .
Ok , you're really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ?
Yes , I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English .
That sounds like a plan to me .
OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble .
You didn't have to do that !
Certainly , Mr . Murphy . Could you come to my office this afternoon at 2:30 ?
Which dish do you like most ?
Do you have cold medicine ?
The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework , attendance , and quizzes are the rest .
OK . I'll take it .
Sir , without happy guests , we are nothing .
like what ?
Teamwork is ok to me , and I hope the team will be complementary in personality .
Short on both sides . Not so much off at the back .
That ' s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon .
Cool ! Teach me !
No , she hasn't .
But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met .
Thank you . I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars .
It ' s been leaking for a couple of days now .
What's the problem with Sons ?
Next time you come back , bring your ID .
That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ?
How old are they ?
I love just about anything by Prince .
I don't know how old he is though .
Thank you , Paul .
In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .
Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice .
I don ' t know . Let me see .
In what way did those social activities have impact on your mind ?
I'm due to check out tomorrow , but I'd like to extend my stay by two days .

Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back .
I hope you didn ' t forget mine !
Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it .
I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that .
OK . Dad ! I'm coming .
Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 .

Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled .

That is a fair price .
Is it ?
Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop .
They sell pizza and burgers at the cafeteria .

I'm more than happy having her in my class .
All right . Just five minutes . Be sure not to touch anything .

We'll play the CD loud , is that all right ?
At Harvard . What about you ?

It's better for you .
Would you agree that the service is fast ?
That ' ll be most helpful .
It ' s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five .
What's wrong with Sons ?
I didn ' t even think about that .
I'm looking for an engagement ring for my girlfriend . I have an idea of what she likes , but I want to surprise her with something special , too .
No , there aren't . I'm sorry .
That ' s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus .
Do you know how to skate , like a skater ?

Yes . Do you mind ?

How long have you been learning it ?

Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ?
She married Jerrod .

But I said thursday . The tickets are for thursday evening .

Leftovers .
How about the car-park space ?
Hey , Cindy , I ' m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ' t have yelled at you in front of everyone .
As far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?

It's very good , and it's fresh too .

Could you book it for me ?
Could you work for us in another state , if need be ?
Oh , I see . I think 90 days is more than enough time .

I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss .
Yes ? Anything I can do for you ?
No , I thought I would take it later .
What does that sign mean ?
Well , I have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now . I am familiar with both hardware and software and with hands-on experience in system development including system analysis and design .
You look great . Your make-up is perfect .
He's cute ! He looks like Tiger Woods ! But , I can't dance ...
Okay . Let me do that right now .
I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite .
No , I knew it all along . He was the obvious choice .
That's good !
How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ?
Can you go to the store for me ?
Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ?
Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best .
By the way , are you married ?
What should I do with my legs then ?
Why do you come back again ?
Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking .
Um , me ?
Yes . I'd like to try Chinese food . But I don't know anything about it .
Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ?
Why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ?
OK . Let's go American . Where's the nearest McDonald's ?
This truck flipped over on the 210 .
I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ?
It's only the rarest coffee in the world ! Didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ?
Three nights .
Hey , your Chinese is coming along !
I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing .
How about stewed-fried steamed pork ?
It ' s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon .
Well , the cultural differences impressed me most .
Certainly . Where are you now ?
I am not !
Arm ... just the usual , Current Deposit please .
Wish me luck .
I ' Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .
Oh , it is precious .
Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb .
Let ' s find out what time it starts .
About fifteen minutes . It's not far . Are you a stranger in New York ?
Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ' s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
So does it mean we're arriving on the same day ?
I'm terrible sorry . I seem to have mislaid your MP4 .
Just think of it as a hobby . Then it's actually fun .
I'd love to , but I'm broke . Maybe after payday .
Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us .
Sure . What about the cloth over there ? It's in fashion .
I am sorry , madam . I didn't hear you . It's too noisy here . Could you please say it again ?
We would prefer 7
Hi ! How are things going with you ?
But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ?
What ? But today is my birthday !
In other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials .
Yes . But not including the utilities .
What do you think ?
Is that all doctor ?
That sounds interesting !
Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing !
Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you .
I need some advice about my fixed deposits .
Just myself . What is the rate ?
I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it .
How many places have you worked altogether ?
Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ?
And who do you sell to ?
Yes , we do . Here is your bill and receipt .
You carried it too far . You obviously offended someone .
Because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want .
All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better !
congratulations ! That's excellent news ? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ?
You are blue in the face , arn't you ?
Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping .
I didn't think there would be a problem .
Yes . What did you think of it ?
We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry .
Yes , it ' s L8V 4B7 .
How about this one ? It's our biggest -- 16 ' in diameter .
Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money .
Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too .
Excuse me , may I help you ?
What especially about the night life are you going to miss ?
Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis .
Good morning . How can I help you ?
Sure . All you need is your student ID card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library .
There's a Kentucky's not far ahead and there's a McDonald's in down street .
I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening , please .
That ' s great . How much is it ?
I'm so honored that you thought to ask me .
Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ?
Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc .
My dear , it's five flights up !
What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ?
Herman , why are you so excited ?
Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room !
Yes . I hope so .
Good afternoon . can I be of any assistance to you ?
That's OK .
I think a surprise party may be better . But I forget when her birthday is .
Fine . Do I have to show my passport ?
Tom , you're my good friend , right ?
It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it .
Hi , Jimmy , good morning .
well , I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager .
If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure !
Pardon me . Could you help me ?
Sure I can , my treat .
Yes , I knew I would make it .
Great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank .
I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her .
Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it .
How long will it take me to get there ?
How about the repairs after the warranty expire ? Are you responsible for the fixing if the machine breaks down after the warranty period ?
Would you be interested in an exchange as opposed to a refund ? I think I can help you to find the appropriate size .
That really does not work for me .
What's your name please ?
Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .
It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow .
Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ?
Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ?
I just meant that she's got different taste .
Do any of the boxes have dancing figures ?
Hello , Green here .
And the bubble wrap ?
Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ?
Good afternoon Sir . I'll have a look at the time-table for you . I'm sorry but there aren't any direct flights available .
Don ' t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck .
Is he breathing ?
Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east .
I'm not at all keen on this subject .
How do you spell your family name ?
Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan .
Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .
Very well . And my favorite subject is Chinese .
The works ?
Online chat ? Aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not ?
When we get paid for this assignment , you get US $ 2 , TOO , and I get US $ 3,000 .
Now that we know what kind of music we will play , we have to decide what each of us will do .
Can you give an example ?
No , of course not . I ' Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ' s toes .
You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill .
250 yuan , please !

Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry .
If you don't like beer , have you tried mixed drinks ? Some of them are pretty good .

Oh , honey , you made a mistake .
George speaks Japanese better than Frank .

What ' s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ?
Do you have an appointment with Mr . Smith ?
Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick .
Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ?
I think so too . I don't like him either . Well , who do you like best ?
No problem . I'll tell you .
I think one of my fillings might be coming loose .
It sure is , but I'm going to call HP first , just to make sure .
That was my fault . I'm sorry .
Tell me what you eat in the morning .
Of course . How can I help you ?
I am not certain about that .
Here is 200 .
Thanks very much . I ' m sure it will sell well . I can ' t wait to read it . Here ' s my card . Thank you for you time .
Do you have green tea perfume ?
Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our wine

Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down .
Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .
It smells like an ashtray in here !
How much do you want to draw ?
OK . I'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . What about you , Nick ?
Mmmm ... This apartment seems a little expensive . Do you have any cheap studios ?
Thank you . How is the light now ?
Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly .
Have you traveled by air before ?
But it's short already , sir .
Well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . You can stick them anywhere .
Yes . I commute five days a week by train .
Which one is this ?
I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .
He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor .
What will you do for this Easter ?
Where did you hit it ?
Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ' t you get out of it ?
I hope I get an easy question like you did .
Yeah , That ' s the one .
We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too .
Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key .
Is that so ? I didn't know it . can I possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ?
Well , I can't help .
Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy and it was published in China Daily .
That's OK . But you'd better take an additional course in some English schools .
How do you solve the website problems when you ' re buying something online ?
Maybe Europe .
Your left brake light is out .

Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more .
They need to be there at eleven in the morning .
What are you planning to do today ?
Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning .
Yes . Do you sell stockings ?
Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible .
Yes , I can do that this afternoon .
Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in !
I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great !
A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .
I am sorry , there are so many travelers that all our tables have been booked on that day .
No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ?
When did you form this hobby ?
You can still drive , without problems .
No , it ' s 3725019281 .
What kind of movies do you like , Sue ?
No , there ' s no need .

Sorry , sir . This is the last one we have in stock .
The pleasure is all mine .
Yes , the language is a part of culture . It reflects a nation's character .
If you don't mind , let's make it a little later . What about three or four ?
Certainly , madam . The deepest place is two meters but you can swim in the shallow area , which is only l . 4 meter in depth . We have separate locker rooms over there and they are free of charge .
Do you have any other symptoms ?
Yes , I'd like to know how to send money to France .
How would you like to pay for it ?
But you did it and did it well !
Will this do ? Your major is not related to banking , as you know .
Isn't this the Whites ?
How about this fruit ?
Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much tv too .
Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms .
Would you mind telling me how old you are ?
How'd you miss it ?
it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that .
It needs to be back on Sunday night . Can you arrange for that ?
Don ' t your relatives visit other relatives ?
Your room number is 707 . Here is your key . The bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . Have a nice evening !
What happened to you last night ? You didn ' t show up .
If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln .
What a pity . Are you likely to be getting more in ?
Do people in different departments get along with each other ?
An Ethiopian restaurant ? Whoa ! I always think of starving people in Ethiopia .
Come on , what have you got to lose ?
Could you talk about it in detail ?
Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you .
... and maybe that's what we both need .
Leave a deposit ? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ?
What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ?
Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ?
Oh , really ? Do you know which company it's from ?
I don't like peppermint ice cream .
Really ? What happened ?
Yes , we did . Do I pay you or the cashier ?
I'm glad you like them . They are all made of silk . Here on display are all the most popular and favorite products . What items are you particularly interested in ?
That's all . Thank you for your co-operation .
Come on . Let ' s walk there .
I ' d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing .
Why aren't you doing your homework ?
How do you do ?
From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches !
Yesterday . He suffered from a serious disease . When he saw the red light , it was too late .

Thank you . What will the blood test tell you ?

I hope to go there someday .
People who are honest , dedicated to their work and have integrity .
No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge .
What have you been up to , Johnny ?
I ' Ve looked over your resume , ms . Jane . I see you ' Ve already have quite a lot of experience in secretary work , could you tell me something about your talent with that company ?
Let me see ... my right arm ... oh , to the east .
But you didn ' t tell me in the interview .
About 7 thirty .
Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
What do I do here ?
I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !
I don't know . I called the police as soon as I found the lock broken .
What is the temperature today , do you know ?
Ok , I won't keep you then .
Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part .
So Kevin , what is your type ?
OK , I'll go to your office at that time .
Here ' s your library card .
I've gotten a few parking tickets before .
Hi , Shelley . Have you had lunch ?
Then I bet he's really good !

Yes , would you leave him a message to call me ?
A little , I wish I could do that .
But watch this ... it bends upwards , just like Dilbert's tie . There's a wire inside .
I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers !
I ' m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ' t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !
Might I suggest a Mac ?
Well , it still hasn ' t reached its destination . I wonder if you could track it down for us . Mr . Reynolds is a bit concerned .
I usually don ' t have time for a bath in the mornings , so I just take a shower . Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ' s winter and I need to warm up .
I'm feeling down .
Too bad . I really like it .
Excuse me , sir . I've made a tough decision and here is my resignation .
Here is a tourist guidebook . You can look it up in the book .
That's all right . We ' ll get used to it . Besides , it is quiet up there .
Not yet . Oh , Madam , this item is no longer on sale , and this goes on sale tomorrow . Will you take them ?
How long have you been here ?
Excuse me . How much for a two liter bottle of Coke ?
What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ...
Are you still hungry , Ryan ? How about some more squid balls ?
Yes , I am expecting some money wired to my account from Taiwan . Would you please check if the money available yet ?
Let me see . Now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it . Well , we can manage it on 20th September . That's the best we can do .
Ah , this is my daughter's birthday present . Her birthday is next week .
Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ' t sunbathe all day .

Where is it located ?
Smoking if possible .
That sounds good . How much is the tour ?
There is so much information and I advise to read newspaper .
Please open the black case .
Have you turned on the air-conditioner ?
You said it , not me .
It's mild , but it's not always pleasant .
If it were up to me , I ' d prefer to go to Pizza Hut . The toppings are much tastier .
Yep , my own special blend ! You can tell by just smelling them ?
You know that fruits and vegetables are very healthy foods ?
What can I offer you here ?
Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal .
I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point .
has your computer turned back on yet ?
You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .
The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ...
Balista , pull me a ristretto .
Sir , I've finished your shaving . Wow , it takes years off you after having a shave .
I enjoy having your daughter in my class .
Oh , please ! I have no idea .
No , I'm afraid not . We only accept our own store credit card .
Hi Anna , come in .
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
What we can do is to assign you a customer manager , that way you can just deal with him . You don't need to deal with anyone else .
No trouble . I enjoyed helping you .
Let me look at the timetable . Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11
Oh , here . I ' m afraid it ' ll be difficult to repair .
We have six .
Yes , I have .
OK , here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture ?
We do have a few fog days in winter . But I would not say we have a lot of fogs . The sky are usually clearly in your city , are they ?
I ate a burger just the other day .
I've had enough .
A white one , please .
It doesn't matter .
You know you didn't .
it's 0-7- 7-8- 7-3- 6-7- 6-8- 8 .
You will stand over here up against this plate .
The ones that are on sale are from Central America .
It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food .
I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States .
Well , I ' m still not sure what you ' re asking me .
I've also been busy .
Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ' t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ' s it . I had to care for them most of the time .
I'm not sure . It could be the tires . Let's stop here .
Look after yourself . Bye .
That ' s all .
No , it isn't very cold at that time . You'll only need some light wool clothing with somejackets and shirts .
Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ?
OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable .
Hello , 8520388 2 .
Your sister said you fainted three times during the injection .
Morning , Mom .
Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ?
OK . Here is the money .
Uh-huh . What else do you want ?
Thanks lot .
You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview .
Do you often do exercise ?
What about the one on the Yellow River Road ?
Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .
OK , sir . Here is your bill . That ' s $ 1000 all together .
Take my word for it .
Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?
Have fun getting ripped off !
That sounds like a great salad .
Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people .
Maybe make-up would be enough ?
Let ' s see ... " Wanted
Why are you cut up recently , Nancy ?
Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply .
well , we ' Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ' t sick .
The air-conditioning is already off , madam .
I am sorry . It's not allowed . If you do want , please go to the smoking section . It's in the back part of the plane .
Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ' Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ' re looking for something a little more practical , we ' Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas .
Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?
I like that one over there . Can you show it to me ?
Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon .
No , thanks . We'll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ?
No , Ah ... single sellers .
You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help .
Really ? Do I have to do it ?
OK , I got it .
Yes , that can be done here . Just make sure you keep the exchange form and the receipt and you can come back at the end of your stay and we'll be only to happy to change it back into foreign currency .
That doesn't justify your violation . May I see your licence , please ?
Let me get a hamburger .
Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months .
It's not raining , darling . The bench isn't wet .
Sure , did you receive the sample we sent last week ?
Are you saying that all my results were normal ?
How many copies am I allowed to make ?
Wow ! You are much skinnier since the last time I saw you .
Yes , you should have .
Why do you want to be a teacher ?
I see . Did anything else happen ?
Of course . They will be used at anytime before or during flight .
How do you like you dishes today ?
I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales .
I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load .
I'm in the Personnel Department .
Mom , it's OK . I will buy a big car one day . It is faster than the bus .
Don ' t worry , I will teach you how to win .
Promise you are not going to be angry ?
Could you fill out this form , please , ma'am ?
At what time ?
But what do most people think about it ?
You can ask her out for drink after work .
We prefer they are on same floor because we have a problem check late that night .
Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that .
He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake .
Repair service , how may I help you ?
Please send me your background information before the meeting so I can look at it .
I'm figuring out my budget .
It's 90 dollars in all .
You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ' t receive your delivery in time .
I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look .
Wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
Mom , don't worry about me , I can do it .
But I can't move the cursor at all . My screen is frozen . What should I do ?
Hello . I have a reservation , under the name Lee , Leo Lee .
Yes , I will introduce the itinerary in detail .
I don't know ! The picture went blank all of a sudden . It's probably the picture tube .
The aroma of roasting coffee beans .
I ' m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ' t you try to get used to Western food ?
That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week .
I hope that the test results show me to be really healthy .
Would you wrap it for me ?
Okay , which ones do I need to take ?
Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for !
Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?
That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ?
Where did you say ?
I dislike it most .
This one suits better . I will take it .
How long is the layover ?

You are a graduate , right ?
For where we live , that is really inexpensive .
No problem . No problem at all . Say , it says here in your resume you studied in California . Great place , isn ' t it ? I studied in California myself . I really enjoyed it . What did you like most about California ?
Okay . Is all going well ?
I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast .

Some of them are of the latest style . Now I have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish business relationship with you .
Well , I think we could be saving more .
I am just getting behind this screen . You need to take a deep breath , hold it , and then breathe normally .
Of course , here you are .
Yes . It was just when I was walking in the park . I saw some children with a newspaper .
Yes , our prices are negotiable , but our quality is not .

I was just as shocked when I found out .
I watched the screen display !
You mean you haven't arranged any car .
Yes . The stimulation mask promotes blood flow and will firm up the skin . You can also choose to either get a hand or back massage as well .

What do you mean by a cast ?

What are your plans for today ?
What ? It ' s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ?
Will you be checking in any baggage today ?
Hmmm . Not good . They ' re too tight . The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ' s pinching my toes . And there ' d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ' t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ' t make shoes like they used to . I ' ll come back another time .
Here we are this is my favorite place .
Excellent choice . ( He brings her the pie . After she finishes , the waiter comes back . ) Would you like anything else ?
Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ?
The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ' t know what to do first .
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
That ' s unbelievable .
It's clogged and water won't go down .
Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ?
No , thanks . I did not notice it has been dark outside . I think it is time to dinner .
What can be done then ?
Yes , I agree with you .
It seems that something is praying heavy on you . What ' s the matter ?
Come here and I will measure you .
We planned our wedding for next May .
What !
So when did this happen ?
Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it . Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him . He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious . What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?
Whoa ! Who said you got the job ?
What are you saying ?
Would you like me to help you on your new project ?
No , I haven't . I've decided I ' m going to travel very light this time .
Uh , are you sure about that ? I thought espresso was an Italian word .

No , I'm afraid not now . I'm too busy .
Where did you see it ?
I just can't decide where to go . It's not an easy decision to make .
most some drinks have too much sugar in them .
That's okay . I'm here a little early . Is it possible to check in right now ?
Because I've already proved it . Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up . I've done it hundreds of times !
I'll have the 5 o'clock one . What time do I check in ?
Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet .
So , let ' s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background .
China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports .
Eight altogether .
Do you like cooking ?
Oh , These are exactly what I ' m looking for .
We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one .
Of course , easy . No sweat .
Whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion .

I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I .

Of course , as long as the card is well kept .
Welcome to our Colonial Tramcar Restaurant , ma'am . Where would you like to sit ?
You can choose a short-term or yearly rental .
Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ?
Most of it is . You should sign up .
Yeah , I guess I should .
I guess I'm adventuresome , but then I'm scared too .
I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
What's your last word as to the delivery date then ?
I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig !
No , nobody .

Well , when you have that , you can take it over to the bookstore . Can you find it ?
As you know , China has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ' s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ?
Richard Zhang .
Hi , Sue . What's up ?
Oh , you are such a dog !
I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning .
That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some .
How about the price of the hardcover ?
Would you like to go to a party tonight ?
Please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel .
It sounds like a good idea .
It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . Es-PRESS-o , get it ?
Then you're not going to go to sleep .
What kind would you like to open ?
Yes , here is your reservation . You have a standard room reserved for two nights . Is that right ?
Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though .
Certainly . The customer is always right , we are here to serve you . Is there a reason that you would like to return it ? Did you have problems with our product or services ?
Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me .
Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ' s not really a shock for me .
About one week .
Glad to meet you . This way , please .
Are they different from other companies ?
I'm not very particular about the design . But I want something of good quality .
Can I get your phone number ?
I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon .
Sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of .
I'd like her to have a change .
Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ?

Are these things negotiable ?
And here is Buckingham Palace ! Look , isn't it beautiful ? It is much bigger than I imagined .
The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ?

There ' s problem with my bank statement . There ' s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM .
Great . What about having a formal interview on Monday next week ?
Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world .
actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own .
Really ? Do you think English is that important ?
Hey , Zina . You're here early today .
We do charge to use the machine .
You'd rather lose to WebTracker than do things my way ?
Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ?
Oh , here comes a bus !
I'd like to start at 3000 yuan a month .
Well , Mr . Zhang , you must know , what we need is a capable accountant , and we won't have enough time to tell him some other things .
Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
Does it make a difference ?
I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets .
Get some eggs , milk , and bread .
Well , if it is elevated , you might have an infection .
I prefer my margarita on the rocks , please .
Let me tell you . First you must buy a ticket .
Just two months ago . There were very big celebrations and there was a spectacular fireworks display . I took part in the great parade myself .
You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday .
Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there .
Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ?
He always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans .
Could you tell me how to use the library ?
What do you have ?
I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye .
No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?
Excuse me . Would you like a drink before your meal ?
You like horror movies ? I don't like them because they're too scary ! I like comedies because I love to laugh .
It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
Have a nice Thanksgiving !
You've made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . It was made in Jingdezhen .
It's a branch of the Bank of America in Beijing .
Have you done any work in this field ? What have you learned from the jobs you have had ?
Hi , Rose . How ' s everything ?
Oh , do you go hiking often ?
I've called you a hundred times today .
This is our first day of class . It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ?
How do you do , Mr . Zhang ? I'm glad to meet you .
I'll miss you too , my friends .
You're just jealous .
You're welcome , sir .
Maybe I'll try that store out .
Yes . I'll have a room free next week .
He never came .
You ' re kidding . We ' ll never make it across in one piece ! Let ' s cross at the light .
Monica Tang .

I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead !
I like to open up a savings account please .
Have a seat over there . How are things going out in the office ?

I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ?
Do you want to mail it by air or sea ?
It was great ! How was your year ?
How long will you be staying , sir ?
I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation .
Are you really ?
I am good at tennis and skiing . What about you ?
Good morning , sir . How may I help you ?
Yeah . I worked about 20 hours a week in a pizza restaurant .
As a graduate , it may be more important to develop myself effectively in my future work . And whatever job I may take , I will make the best efforts .

I ' m happy to hear you say that .
Li Lei , can you tell me what the origin of Easter is ?
Could you fill out this application ?
Certainly , sir .
So what's the problem ?
You can talk with him .
Yes , it is . This perfume just arrived yesterday , and it's the latest products of Chanel .
You're right . Life isn't always like the movies .
No , that ' s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ' Day .
It's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ?
How can we get in touch with you ?
You ' re not nervous , are you ?
Hi . What's up ?
I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor .
What about your parking spot ?
Oh , yes . Laura ' s the oldest . She ' s a computer programmer .
Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job .
Fair enough !
No . The bookshelf is full of fashion books .
My date is quite sophisticated . She would expect nothing less than the best .
You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects . Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee
Oh , sorry . There is a pencil behind the cup .
I have to do some shopping .
So what do you think of the American fast food culture ?
I'd like to try the chef's special .
Their interest rates are usually quite high . It ' s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
Doesn't look like it to me .
Where are you going for lunch ?
Oh , did you ?
Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it .
Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract .
So I can attend conferences and do business on that visa ?
well , we can ask people to make small contributions .
Where did you visit ?
What happened to this one ?
It's in the South of China .
For the past eight years , I have been working in the banking industry . I have a solid understanding of accounting concepts , an analytical mind and a strong attention to detail . I've had a lot of customer service training and experience , and I have been told that I excel in this area .
Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing !
Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .
Why don't you get it all fixed ?
Well , how do I put this ? France is a terrible team .
See you tomorrow .
That's not a bad idea . How much is it ?
So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?
That's what friends are for .
Only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success .
Welcome to our school . If you need any help , please come to me .
Let me go get it for you .
That's quite a lovely weather .
Toss a coin to decide then .
This one .
But they are a little tight , They Pinch .
I see . I will take 9 bags of sugar so that I can get 3 coupons .
Yes . Thanks .
You look very young . How old are you ?
are you serious ?
Oh , it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics ' Emblem . It's a Chinese seal , meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world .
sure . Would it be alright if I brought a few friends ?
About ten days ago . I ' Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ' t . it ' s very frustrating .
I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
I haven ' t seen you for several days .
Good morning , Madam , can I take your order now ?
Good morning Mr Smith . My name is Susan and I am a reporter for the Evening Star .
OK . Shall we go to a bar ?
if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
Excuse me , madam ! You parked in the handicapped spot .
You are booked on the A943 on 16/11 at 17:30 pm to Hong Kong with Cathy Pacific .
The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine .
One time , I tried garlic ice cream .
That sounds good , Fred !
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
so you can speak Chinese ?
they look delicious . I think she'll be pleased .
You should've been done already .
The ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ' s out of bounds .
My name is James Owen . I ' m Manager of Sales . How do you do ?
Yes . That ' s fine . We can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . Could you give me your name please ?
That sounds like a good idea !
Yeah , I think we have met somewhere before . That ' s right ! We met at Aaron ' s place last weekend ! What a coincidence ! But anyway , I ' m glad to see that you ' re not too badly hurt , and I should probably get going . I have a nine o ' clock meeting .
Well , I guess for $ 400 a month I shouldn't expect an all bills paid apartment .
Alright , so I'll see you then ?
Doesn ' t sound like that ' s be fun , then . Do you want to come here ?
Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it .
Oh , I think I should try to read one .
I can ' t vote on Tuesday .
Sir , sir , are you all right , sir ?
I need you to help me set up for my presentation Thursday morning .
As much as we can .
So what does that have to do with this position ?
What is your favorite kind of music ?
And is she helping him ?
Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ?
What's your nationality ?
so you're a big fan , eh ?
I know . But I couldn ' t help .
Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand .
And so ...
That's not exactly a conversation piece . It's so plain .
Mr Moon , how good to see you again .
That's it ?
My I have your name , please , sir ?
What type of movie is that ?
Mr . Sellers ? It's Steven speaking , your tenant . We've just suffered a power failure . What should I do now ?
Is the place well-furnished ?
How many rooms are you looking for ?
He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant .
It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score .
You can't pay your fine without your ID .
There is a warrant out for your arrest .
Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it .
Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them .
How do you want to your mustache trimmed ?
Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way .
The mangoes are on sale today .
He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ?
Just a minute please , Mr . White .
Pretty well , thanks . We ' Ve just been incredibly busy ! I need to set up a meeting for Mr . Graham .
Yes . I like it very much .
I'll take one right now for seven dollars .
sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area .
My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
Hey , John ! What do you think are the main causes of war today ?
Do you like shopping ?
I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place .
Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .
The building is quite new and well constructed . I ' m happy with the fittings too .
There are a lot of papers !
I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry !
Almost 30 % of the consumers can ' t accept the price . Maybe we should lower our price a little .
Our son is gone and my heart is gone too . I don ' t know how to spend the rest of my years .
What kind of work are you doing now ?
Let's see , can I get some fried zucchini , please ?
I've found a nice place in this district . Three bedrooms , a large kitchen .
What's the problem with your internet ?
I ' ll just have to put up with it .
If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ?
If you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week .
you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met !
Yes , my old friend Hanson lives there
About 80 million dollars .
But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
Excuse me , sir .
Oh . In that case , I'll pay cash .
Yes . We are kind and welcoming people . It is not a secret society or something like that .
Then just press the black button all the way down .
Settle down , Elvin . If you're not careful , you'll give our plan away . Zina's smart , you know .
Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . Don ' t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan .
Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ?
Can you working under pressure ?
He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better .

Please come in , Mr . Jackson .
Oh ! Thank you ! It's very kind of you .
Hey ! Man , put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to .
I was there between 88 and 90 .

Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ?
If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand .
I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract .
Wow , Arthur ! You ' re as blind as a bat !
Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ?
I had no idea that I ran it .
That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink .
Now , if you'll just sign here , the Mac is all yours .

Oh , bathroom blues .
Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby .
Certainly ! Would you like my American Express card ?

Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ' s showing your respect to your co-workers .
The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ?

That ' s for sure . You ' ll know our products better after the visit .
So your room number is 201 . Are you a member of our hotel ?

It ' s all right .

We had extra time of course .
Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way .
Get out of it ! It wasn't as good as you think .
Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time ?
I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ?

That won ' t be a problem .
Sounds like I'm missing out on a good time . Oh , well , there's always next year .
What day is it ?
Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday .
Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell .

You said it ! I can't believe he lasted as long as he did .
Spring .
I'm hungry .
Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot .
It's a great honor to have you here , Mr . Brown .
Go to a voting booth and vote .
That's cool .
we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why , I just have a long routine .
I think you made the right decision .
Excuse me , driver . Let me off here , please .
I really appreciated it .
Could you tell me where the office is located ?
He's a hero in our town .
I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
But they are closed today .

I'd suggest that you go to the Philately Store in Nanjing Road East , where the items are authentic and the prices are reasonable .
I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ?
The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions .
Great . At first , you can put the chairs back .
That's exactly why my business is doing so well !
No , ice will spoil the taste .
John ? Can you come over here for a second ?
They give me a lot of congratulations .
He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet , and could offer me an appropriate job .
Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York .
Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count .
Do you feel tired ?
For example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction .
What do you plan to do for your birthday ?
Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates !
It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth .
Mary , it seems that your family and friends have been calling you recently , am I right ?
Kara , would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday ?
You can check them from the fax yesterday .
Five percent .
Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished . They've even decided to come in on the weekend .
I don ' t think so . As the saying goes , " A great oak needs deep roots . " I ' m really interested in this job .
Wine ' s fine by me . Let ' s order a bottle of the house red then .
When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out .
Well , why should we hire you ?
How did it grow into such a large place ?

I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ?
Yes , Steven . You always know what I want .
I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
You look so tan and healthy !
I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online .
Hi , could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch ?
Would you like to choose a chicken ?
I'm from Germany .
Which university will you go to ?
Oh , yes . That is a beautiful color . It has been a very popular lipstick this season . I have just two left .
You can have a different carpet , but you have to pay more if it costs more .

It wasn't enough , because I'm hungry again .
My hat ' s new , too .
This is the house I want to rent .
Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work !
How do you get along with your co-workers ?
Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ' Ve never had one before . It is very nice .
So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work .
I will try my best . Here is the draft . Would you please go over it and see if any modifications are needed ?
Yup , it ' s all set .
I really can't stand going to parties .
Don't worry about that . I'll reimburse you as soon as I receive the package .
I'm looking for a gift for my daughter .
Are you on the top floor , or is there another apartment above you ?
Not bad . At least I am still alive .
Albert ? Could you co-sign this approval sheet ? Accounting ' s getting really picky .
Well , I ' m sure he had a perfectly good reason ...
I need to take care of some business that morning .
Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language .

Regarding what exactly ?
What was the charge for ?
Wait a moment . Here is $ 10 you paid for duties .

I like the apartment , but I see something wrong with it .
We are not seeing each other any more .
Hello ! How are you .
Thanks . I appreciate it .

I have made a reservation for my breakfast last night . But I still haven't got it . I am so hungry now .
Well , Betty . Since you ' Ve done well during the probation period , we decided to employ you formally . And now we need to sign the formal agreement .
Just do like this . Very simple .
I have heard about it while in China . it is called a " yard sale " . I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big " yard sale " .

I love the dancing figures . I'll take this music box .
I think this suits me . Can I try it on ?
Looks like anything fun makes you excited .
Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ?
Maybe he shouldn ' t come to collage , he should become a football star .
We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn .

The van will be driven by Mary and me .
How has school been going ? You come home so late every night ! You're really a hard worker ...

Is she attractive ? I don ' t think I know anyone like that .
What ' s happened ? Is there a problem ?
I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English .
Because too many people in the office are on holiday .
Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening !
No . I ' m serious . I ' m going to quit my job .
That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever .
Good idea ! Let's make ready , then .
They're much better
Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you .
By the way , is the fair the same for any distance ?
Yes . But only if you ask me nicely .
He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions .
I need more water !
It's a lovely day , isn't it ?
Yes ? Why not ?
That's true . We can not judge people by appearance .
I stayed up all night writing a report .
Would you mind relocating ?
You will never guess where my family is going for summer vacation .
I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it .
If you need anything else , please feel free to ask me
Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ?
Come on . You ' ll feel better after we hit the showers .
There ' s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company l

OK . Where ?
You have gone against the traffic rules .
Is your waist any better ?
It's OK . Thank you .
Well , uh ... I didn't catch the last part .
Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking . You feel the same way about France , don't you ?
nothing .
Yes , it does . Now could I have your name , please ?
OK , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ?
No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ' re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age .

I ' m in the middle of something right now . I ' ll be there in a second .
Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ?
That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders .
You must be joking . Those two ?
Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected .
When can you get the finished product to me ?
Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect .
No , it doesn't . And there's a maintenance fee for each month . It's forty NT per ping .
After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations .
On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
I want this letter registered . There is something valuable inside .
OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ?
What's her job ?
Round trip or one way trip ?
We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery .
If you are in a hurry , you should take a taxi .
Would you rather have her or your old boss back ?
What I can tell you is that I voted for our next President of the United States .
What's the weather like ?
So why are you dieting this time anyway ? Another guy ?
Make sure to catch it going west .
Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car .
May I have my bill , please ?
Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ' t you just sit and watch ?
But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ?
Let me see . It's five minutes to eleven .
AKIM 400 .
Thanks . I think you look nice today , too .
How can you say that ? But , you could give me a piggyback the rest of the way .
Where can I get the information , Kate ?
Yes , it has great curb appeal .
Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch .
And all of the flowers are in bloom .
It's not that I don't like your cooking , but I ate some cookies before we had dinner .
Oh , I see . But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go . " I think it will be better if you have more money .
I will make an arrangement for it .
All I do all day is work and watch TV . I really should start thinking about my health .
Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .
I don't think the lecture is very interesting .
I didn't sleep a wink last night .
I have a lot of work in the office and a lot of chores in the house . How I envy you , Robin !
Really ? That's great to know .
What reason do you have for missing school ?
I thought you would like PE .
Certainly madam . Here ' s your key . Your room is on the 7th floor and on the left . Room 781 . Check out is at 12 noon .
All right . What's the problem ?
Here's a twenty note .
What does she teach ?
Sure , here you go .
Dieting . It's the price we pay to make men notice us .
Fine ! I ' ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ?
I will open it for you right now .
This one , Shogun , looks good .
I ' m sorry you didn ' t get accepted .
what's the cost ?
When you're thirsty , you're not supposed to drink soda .
Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .
Which one is cheaper ?
Good morning . My name's Jason Smith .
Size one . By the way , what if I bring home this sweater and my wife doesn ' t like it ?
You are really a wet blanket .
I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal .
Thank you for your delicious meal .
Do you know where she went ?
Yes , your check will be a little late in getting to you .
It just started hurting me last night .
Show me the black one , my size .
What's the difference ?
Do you prefer brandy or ports .
right now , I'm doing some research into the languages of different African tribes .
Thank you for joining us ! Now let's see some pictures and know more about kung fu .
And when would you like the rooms ?
No problem . First of all , we can provide a business licence . Secondly , Enterprise ID Certificates , Forex registration and ...
You and Tom also make a great couple .
Good , I have my backpack and my camera tripod .
How do you feel about overtime work ?
No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English .
I'm sorry it took so long .
Nah , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter .
It ' s a start , but I ' ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise !
That's perfectly all right .
Thank you for you help .
that wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ?
That looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?
No , it stopped at Honolulu . Would you like to book one ?
Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10 ?
What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ?
I've paid for it . Here's the receipt .
Afraid so . The more the better .
I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ?
To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here .
Several minutes .
I hope so . Would you like to join me ?
I would like to make an appointment to discuss the problems I keep having with my apartment .
I'm sorry , but I think you should give me no less than 65 yuan .
Why ? What do you mean by that ?
They're going to give us back the seats ?
Mister , I have an account now .
Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ?
they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . That should give you enough time to have a quick shower .
I don't need a car . I walk to work .
First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible .
That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks .
Airport security . Could you empty your pockets over here , please ?
Your dentist must be proud of you !
Dream on !
Check the local time before you call . You don't want to wake your friend up by accident .
Sure , I'll go get it for you .
We never fail to meet our client's expectation .
Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
That's a good idea . Let's go !
Okay . But our baby has fallen sleep .
No . These terms need to be amplified .
No wonder .
But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a god job right now .
sure , what would you like to discuss ?
And nobody knows who built them , right ? It's a total mystery !
Bye-bye .
I ' m afraid you can ' t . you ' Ve to go out there and walk around .
the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home .
Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week .
Cinct de mayo ?
Where did you go to university ?
Have you ever done your shopping at Whole Foods market ?
She had a sudden heart attack .
That is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music .
I really have no excuse , madam .
I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them .
Yes . And what dances do you like best ?
Well , let ' s see . I ' d like to go to see the Summer Palace .
But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough .
I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat .
You can bring one , if you want to .
Don ' t you think people get their personalities from their parents ?
Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job .

I need to cancel an account .
I know that magazine . It ' s very popular .
I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM ' s China Head quarters .
Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II .
That'd be nice .
It doesn't take much time . I ' m used to tidying up my room myself .
And you think about her all the time ?
Not much , Just a house party with some friends .
Would you like an extra blanket ?
I wish he could understand . You know what , if this goes on , I think I will get stick like everybody else .
I'm very sorry , sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this .
That ' s right . Then wait for the green light and turn the handle .
Certainly , work always comes first .
Oh , good morning , Mrs . Liu . I'm calling to see if you have received my resume that I sent to you by Email .
Anything else today ?
For real ?
Mary , how was your date with john ?
Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave .
Don ' t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work .
Thank you , please fill out this form for us .

Oh , I know that place . It ' s only two minutes drive .
She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden .
Is there anything valuable in it ?
Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .
Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ?
Are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon ?
Yes , we do , thank you .
Are you sick ?
May I take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
It's no big deal .
Yeah . She's a healthy beautiful girl .
This feels great . I'm all reed up . I can keep going all night .
They said I matched the description of a robber .
Just over a year I think . Why , what's the problem ?
Sure . But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?

Oh , I see . Then can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ?
It sounds interesting .
1 thirty P . m . But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P . m .
Can I borrow some money from you ?
It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait . You aren't bleeding , are you ?

Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings .
I lost track of time , am I late ?

We can do that . It'll just cost you extra .
Hello again . Have you come to a decision ?
She is threatening to evict us for not paying the full rent .

Goodbye , Alice .
I would like the student pass .

You are welcome . Have a safe trip .
Similar to a Promissory Note , yes . I can deal with that for you right here . The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation .
David , I heard you lost your job .
I think that the most important thing is you can ' t live all by himself . It takes a lot of people working and cooperating together . The more really close friends I have , the better .
How long will I wait for ?
What a beautiful day !

Those are good answers . How did she react ?
What kind of medicines does the doctor usually prescribe to children who get high fever ?
Oh , I'm afraid it's too expensive . Can you show me something cheaper ?

Are you sure of that ?

OK , thanks .
Ok , shall I make a coffee first ?
Really ? Who made that rule up ?
Sure . There's network of canals . And there are white walls , black tiles , small bridges , flowing rivers , flagstones roads , blue sky and white clouds . Few places have preserved the past like this place . Walking on the ancient road makes us back to our sense .

Really ? But can you guarantee the safety ?
Well , I wasn't planning on spending that much money today , so ...
OK . I'll try . But I'm not sure Federal Express picks up mail in this city . If that's the case , I'll send the package through Chinese express mail service .
OK . I will deposit my bag right now .
You better do some exercise every morning .
Oh , it's the first of April , April fool's day
May I have your ticket and passport please ?

I don ' t think I can get up enough nerve to do this .
OK , we could look at that .
May I know what you do ?
Yes , this is . May I help you ?
I think that unfortunately it ' s more important than a person ' s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ' s wrong , but that ' s the way the world is now .
Yes , almost all the families have their own cars .
OK . I'll see you then .
Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ?

I can't think the same .
Your budget is a good idea .
I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool .

That's a great relief . I was worried about him .
Did you go to the movie yesterday ?
Your car is ready .
The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one .
About 50 miles .
What's it like ?
I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked .
Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total .
Yes . In 1996 I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Hebes University , and in 2001 I received my MBA degree from Peking University .

Then I will send it by air , thank you .
I usually take the five thirty home .
We are going to Jingshan Park . Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park .
Oh yes I am . I have always wanted to go to the States . I love meeting new people and making new friends .
Do you have a cold ?
What's the matter with you , Paul ?
What about the divided skirt ?
Yes , I'd like a large soda , please .
For the past 5 years , I have been in an Ericsson ( China ) Communication Co , Ltd .

You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses .
Welcome to Beijing . This is my business card . I'm an engineer . If you need any help in Beijing , just give me a call .

Oh I hope not , my first marriage was a mistake , but this one isn ' t .
You do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
Okay , let's sit over there .
I thought they had already agreed to everything . That ' s going to take weeks to rework .
I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % .
He's number four .
Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year .
What are those . Miss Liu ?
can I see these silk ties ?
Let's blow on it .

Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ?
It ' s going pretty well , but I ' m really tired !
Now I am afraid I can't get to the airport on that day . I want to change my flight for the 21st . Is that all right ?
Let me tell you the story . In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called " Good Morning to you " . But later someone added the words " Happy Birthday " to their tune .
It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider .
I think I'm going to go home .
How come so cheap ?
I've heard about Enrail passes . So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot .
But I don't know what to do .

The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?
Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on .
Neither , can I have them scrambled ?

May it be used as a sofa in the day and a bed during the night ?
I'd rather have a cup of coffee .
Hi honey ! What ' s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?
I was wondering if I could collect unemployment benefits .
Actually most of them are dirty . I haven't done laundry in a while . I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house .
Yes , sir . It'll be a moment .
Within 2 weeks once we receive your orders .
When do you have in mind ?
I have had disagreement with every director . I ' Ve worked with . We ' Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ' t no
Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ?
I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see .
I'm coming back on the 17th .
You're not looking happy . What ' s the matter ?
Not bad . Actually , it makes me look younger . I like it .

Sorry to bother you . But I ' m having a small problem I thought you might be able to help me with .
Yes , but it's much smaller .
It ' s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy .
Okay . Thank you very much .
I was born on April 15 , 1986 .
I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment .

I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ?
I guess I'd buy that ...
Good question . I have to think about it .
Which aisle has the produce ?
I think you must have heard wrong . The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten . We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor . It ' s not good news at all ...

Oh , no . Go ahead .
Yes , Five one dollar stamps , please .
Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ?
Hi Julie , how are things going ?
I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P . m .
Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise .
Do you need anything else ?
Hi Tina , It's Joe .
I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details !
She's trying to be supportive , but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well .
Thanks , doc . I ' Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ' t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth .
If I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer .
Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them .
I ' m sorry , but I can ' t find the book that you lend me .
With the tax , your total is $ 32 . 42 . Would you like to charge it ?
I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing .
And what is this ?
I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical .
I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ' t have the willpower to just quit . I can ' t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?
Yes , everything is fine .
Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places .
You're welcome , Diane . I hope you can visit us again soon .
So you are .
Fine , I will pencil that in right now . We will see you then .
I ' Ve been busy , Hilary . We can set up a meeting to talk about the deal , but I still feel the same way . I don ' t think it ' s worth it .
Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ?
Wow ! What about the memory ?
Ok , see you .
Well , that's a thing .
I'd like to talk with you again about what happened .
What book is that ?
I had a great time . It ' ll be good to see them again .
Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ?
That sounds great . Is it casual ?
I need to save the rest .
Yes , I can give you a reservation on that .
The next bus will be here in four minutes .
Double A , R , O , N . Thank you , Mr . Johnson . May I know your arrival time on April 16th ?
Are there any Psychology classes available ?
Do they have any children ?
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ?
Yes , I will . Do you need it finished right away ?
Oh , I'm sorry .
But promise me , you'll keep it a secret .
I'm sorry , I'm engaged at 2 p . m .
Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go !
Actually I will ! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go . I like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy .
Thursday mornings are usually the slowest around here . Why don ' t we set it for Thursday at 10:00 a . m . ?
But I purchased it yesterday .
And those pencils ? What should I do with them ?
I ' m fine . I ' Ve been out of town . I just got back .
Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot .
All right . Will there be anything else ?
Surely , there are other ways to save money .
I'm afraid not . They were both wearing stockings over their faces .
Excuse me , are you Mr Williams from America ?
Around 3pm .
German .
What would you do after that ?
OK . Here is the money . Thank you very much .
What happened ?
Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday .
Are you going somewhere ?
Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet .
Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ?
How old is he ?
Yes . Everything is fine in the apartment . But I know nothing about this area . Could I ask you some questions ?
Yeah , I've been out of town .
Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family .
What are you eating ?
We haven't . Hurry up !
I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble .
Oh , that goes in the refrigerator .
That's possible . At that time , they can choose any activity they like .
Sure , honey , we ' re talking now , aren ' t we ?
It opens at 9:00 from April to October .
What repayment period were you thinking of ?
did you have to wear uniforms ?
Where do I start ?
Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ?
I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now .
Overtime work is very common in companies . I can work overtime if it's necessary , but I don ' t think we will work overtime everyday .
Would you like me to type it for you ?
Fast food restaurants are popular now .
How nice ! Have fun !
I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done .
Thank you ! Have a nice day !
Ok . I've got a list of place that fit your requirements . Let's just go through them . The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from the university .
Pleasure is mine . Here ' s my card .
We can do that , but you'll have to pay a little extra .
Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time .
I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money .
Good evening .
I couldn't agree with you .
Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
And what do you do , Ted ?
Good morning ! Do you have any rooms available at the moment ?
I can check for you , if you'd like .
Hi , Kate .
Forget it ! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow .
A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you .
Do you have any special interests besides your job ?
I know the feeling . I ' m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ' s right around the corner .
Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person .
You will be very beautiful on your wedding day .
I main market reasearch , and you ?
I have to say you're a well-matched couple .
Billy , you don ' t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school .
The complaint rate for our new product line is very high , almost eight percent .
what do you think ? Does it taste good ?
What am I to do ?
did you take a photo with her ?
Yeah ? What does he want ?
I'm waiting for our President to lower the gas prices .
Okay . You're in room 507 . It's a single queen-size bed , spacious , and nonsmoking . Is that suitable ?
No . I'm from Taiwan . Can't you see ?
Well , the reason why I am calling is to tell her that our appointment in next month will have to be postponed . And the exact time for this meeting will be discussed after she comes back .
Certainly . ( He brings her the sauce ) Here you are . Can get you anything else ?
A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases . Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc .
My name is Steven and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I have graduated from Peking University . I majored in business administration .
I don't have one single favorite , but these days I listen to a lot of Chopin .
I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it .
The NASDAQ gained a few points today .
One last question
It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up .
perfect !
I heard that Janet has got a new job . She ' s working for the united investment group . I heard that they pay very well .
Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ?
When will you be leaving ?
So , where did you grow up ?
Basically , a swim station is like a treadmill , except instead of running , you swim .
Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ?
You'll cook it of course !
Perfect ! You'll be working alone on that portion . Do you like to work alone ?
Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .
Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back .
But you're busy , aren't you ?
You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight .
Ha-ha ! You got me there !
It could be the battery . Let me Check it .
Akha .
This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting .
Will the internet even pop up ?
Do you plan on voting this Tuesday ?
I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me .
553-2213 . Great , thanks .
Is 11:30 AM OK ?
Which is your preference , tea or coffee ?
No , and I haven ' t done anything out of the ordinary .
you refused the gift ? That's terrible .
Now tell me , what's your problem ?
Hi , Karen . This is John Williams in the purchasing department . Can you check to see if there ' s a package down there for me ?
Good . So you will have no trouble finding it .
Thank you . I have got quite clear idea of it .
that ' s true . I really should go home and prepare for the next test , but I ' m feeling tired .
Will it snow today ?
Either way . I don ' t care .
I'm from Madras .
Is it far ?
So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ?
well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . You should try it at least once .
Do you know what the BBS is ?
Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on !
Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
No ! ! !
Your arms need to be raised to shoulder height .
Thanks , Frank . I ' d love to come . When is it ?
The post office ? Sorry , I'm not sure .
Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ?
Yeah . That ' s right . What can I do for you ?
Something's wrong with my air conditioning .
It was after 2 am .
It's like this . It's square with a leather cover . Yes , I remember , there is a green string around the handle . That's right .
They are too bright .
3 weeks . I am here on tour .
Her acting is OK .
Any other benefits ?
Dad , when will you finish your cooking ?
I'll get that for you right now .
About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time .
When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?
Nice to meet you Mr . Taylor .
I usually play with my school-mates .
I'm wondering if anyone has turned in a train ticket . I just lost my ticket for Beijing tonight .
Can you read and write English well ?
He must be very brave .
Does that mean I can't use it tonight ?
Well . It ' s certainly nice . You ' Ve done a great job .
When are you going to make it ?
Excuse me , could you please turn on the air-conditioner , it's so hot here .
OK . I see .
We are terribly sorry for that . Could you please buy a new one and give us the receipt ? We will refund the cost of the laundry and the new sweater .
That's life .
I'm afraid I've got to go . I have another appointment at five .
Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved !
While staying in love is even better .
It was great meeting you .
Yes , the service was quite good .
I get that , but let me just sleep for a little bit longer .
I'm afraid not .
No , your uncle Jack is my brother , Bill is my brother-in-law , your mom's brother .
Stretching exercise after sitting a long time .
That is the best part . Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this
Yes , sure . Have a sweet dream !
And after the meeting ?
So , what did you get them ?
That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years . Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible .
Ok . And I ' d like to check these books out .
Thank you . Hopefully I won't have to call about him again .
Silly , you should make sure he does .
Hello , I was just looking for the guide .
What sort of problems do you have with these machines ?
I feel so tired .
I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach .
Ok . You haven ' t seen my company car , have you ?
Don ' t be intimidated . There is a lot to sign , but I will explain everything to you very clearly .
May I help you , madam ?
Got it , Mom .
Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day !
I'd rather have meat .
that sounds exciting . Where did you go ?
I am frigid I can't be there on time .
Yes , I ' d like to reserve a room .
It's too late . You see , in our market October is the season for the kind of commodity . So the goods must be shipped before October or we won't be ready for the season .
Yes . But I don't know the exact time .
Nice day today , isn't it ?
Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow .
Yes , that's quite all right for me . Can we change it ?
A bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare would hit the spot .
Yes . I appreciate all help and in particular , all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here .
Tony Bush .
Thank you . My husband gave it to me .
Would you like some of coffee ?
What did your boss say ?
Be my guest .
Do you have any other computer qualifications ?
Haha , I just got the Ultraman costume . My Dad bought it .
Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice .
I'm not sure . But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join . They have great deals occasionally . They are very good for people who like to buy new things all
I call the landlord right now .
Excuse me , sir . Didn't you see the red light ?
I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ?
There were some bad misses in his defence , so he lost it .
Congratulations on the new house !
Got it .
You ' re lying .
Can you name a few examples ?
Good morning , sir .
I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm .
I don't think so , Maria , but I think you can look for information on the Internet .
You ' re right , I don ' t want to pay , but I don ' t want to live without pay , either .
Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now .
So , why did you leave PCC ?
Please wait a moment while I check availability . Ah , I'm sorry , sir . We only have a double room available now .
She ' s my wife ! Oh , here ' s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye .
Alright , Ma'am . And what color did you want ?
I'd love to help if I can .
What salary do you get for your present position ?
I did but now I ' m for Microsoft . How are things with you ?
I'm going to New York .
Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ' t wait to sample all the snacks .
That's all right . When you come , ask for Smith , OK ?
Right . I ' ll have him call you back .
Is this your car ?
How about the price and the bank mortgage ?
And I can choose any color ?
Do you think they two will get married ?
if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ?
Should we remember all the new words and expressions ?
I'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ?
I guess that you will really be dressing down .
It is half past one .
That ' s a good decision . They have many good job search tools there .
Hi , Francis .
shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ?
I'm sorry . I'll get you a new player .
I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat .
I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart .
You are right . Our company ' s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking .
I've got a bone to pick with you over your last shipment to Dalian . A part of the goods were damaged in transit .
Here is ten Yuan .
Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ?
You don't look very well .
What you said gives me the creeps !
Sounds good , let me get that .
Craig , what do you do for work ?
You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job .
We do , as most hotels do .
Well then , where do I get it ?
Oh , no , I'm afraid not . These things are just too old to guarantee anything .
Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ?
I'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can .
I voted for our next President .
I'm afraid my association with Broadway musicals is rather limited .
Yes , of course . Step in , please !
Of course I ' m nervous .
Sure . What is it ?
That ' s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month .
Really ? Congratulations .
The exam ! The terrible exam ! I'm not ready yet . Can you tell me how to get good marks ?
That's all . Thank you .
What ' s your long term goal ?
Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices .
No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married .
I won ' t .
Fill it up with regular , please .
Do you mind if I come over to use your computer ?
Okay . Don't forget to call Susan .
We are through .
Any other ideas ?
Ok , but don't delay too long , or that trip will be all booked .
I just felt that the paper couldn ' t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
I think you've lost it .
How much for the shirts ?
This is Chinese made .
Let me see . En . Here is your baggage .
Cruise control ? I don't like that .
Good . After Stars . com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore .
Didn't I tell you ? It's over !
We are going to go through these bit by bit . You will have plenty of time to read the fine print .
So you have two brothers ?
Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ?
These are our cheapest coats , madam .
Would you like anything else ?
I guess I was stunned for a moment , then I quickly ran away to get help .
The Merriman satin sheets ?
Why do you choose this field as your career ?
Yes , I joined your group of bus tour this morning . You promised the journey will last 3 hours and we will visit 15 sightseeing spots .
How about the passengers ?
You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone .
I can't help you .
Got it . What's the proper time for tea ?
I know . I know !
Thanks and you too .
That's right . We are their sole PR sector business .
I already had that idea .
Just sign here , please .
I would like to exchange Chinese money into German currency please .
Yeah , good idea . We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot .
There are various choices of blood pressure medication that we can try .
Then this is the right bus . Move on , please . You're holding up the passengers . Tian'anmen Square is the last stop but one .
Why ? I'd just be dead tired for the rest of the day .
Bulldog 123 . Are you sure that's all ?
Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ?
The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one .
I feel he is as cold as charity to me .
I don't know . Will you forgive me ?
Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report .
Take it easy . I have to cut my losses .
Yes , thank you very much .
What are you taking my blood for ?
You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable .
Yes , please ask her to call John Smith .
I passed College English Test Band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ' t think certificates are necessary if what ' s needed is merely operating a computer . I think practically , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I am quite familiar with Microsoft Office .
OK , here you are . Please sign your name here .
Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ?
Very well , we have a couple of different options such as beaches , the wilderness , the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
All right . Let ' s go .
What are step-sisters ?
A goal !
December 1st .
Good evening , sir . Welcome to the Comfort Inn .
Full insurance , please .
Of course . We both experienced a good cooperation .
Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ?
That ' s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ' s coming now ! She looks gorgeous . Wait , what ' s she doing ? Where ' s she going ?
Let me check . Well , in October .
This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
Yeah , it's really convenient . The theater and Shopping Mall are within walking distance . Well , I got to go . I'll get in touch with you soon .
I'm afraid I've spilt ink all over the table-cloth .
Good morning . Mrs . Smith .
A pipe broke in my wall , and water is leaking .
I've wanted to be involved in engineering ever since I was little . And my study has equipped me with a career as a mechanical engineer .
If she has , they must be fair-weather friends .
Well , there are a lot of storybooks upstairs in our children's section . Some are written for young children , others for teens . Maybe some of them will suit your needs .
I ' m sorry to hear that .
It says No smoking .
Are you being served , Sir ?
Kentucky's ? Is that a chain restaurant ?
I don't know , but he gives me the creeps .
Good luck .
Well , do you have through tickets ?
have you ever been denied a visa before ?
Looking at the spice rack , I ' d say you ' Ve been learning how to make asian food .
Mine aren't so good , either .
And we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof .
They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law .
fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight .
Right . What are you going to do tonight ?
No , I have't got the chance to meet the famous professor yet .
Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
One way or round trip ?
Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return .
So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job ?
OK , it's my fault . I'll stay here and look after our stuff . You can get in , shopping with Daniel and May .
Yes , Jane says they will go to China .
Oh , Babe , I can ' t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ' t wait for all the adventures we ' re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ' t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you .
I came in response to your advertisement for a salesperson .
That is high .
Do you play basketball well ?
I can help you . How much money do you make per year ?
Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . We're set up for wireless right here .
That ' s a nice dress . It ' s very smart .
What's the weather like in your country ? I suppose it must be warmer than here .
I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs .
Okay , I ' ll take this one . Does it come with batteries and a case ?
Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day .
We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon .
Do you mind if I go with you ?
That's all right . May you have a good trip !
Yes , and he also ...
Are you okay ?
Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are .
Most animals are not locked up in tiny cages . Rather , they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens .
Can you show me how to make an overseas call ?
He's really a good player .
Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ?
Good coming , sir .
My pal , you are so nervous recently . You don't need to be like that .
I think it ' s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .
For how many people ?
That is OK sometimes .
Call me tomorrow then .
Do you ride this bus often ?
It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ' s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining .
Goodness me ! What a choice ! I think I ' ll have a cappuccino please .
Your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ?
When will it begin ?
He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
That sounds like fun .
With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly .
We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with .
Oh , it ' s a pity . What was the matter ?
Not bad , but I'm a little tired .
Let me see ... I'm sorry , but we don't have any more non-smoking rooms . We won't charge you for your room tonight .
Thanks for saying that .
Yes , but dinner was excellent
Than you , I'm not late , am I ?
What are the fundamental course ?

Excuse me . Could you please take a picture of us with this camera ?
Two yuan , please .
Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ?
What else is wrong with it ?
I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced . You should be fine .
Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ?
There are people everywhere . What ' s that girl doing ?
We went to Malaysia and Thailand .
Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now .
Bring me one and besides , I would like to have a chicken cream soup .
Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play .
It's so that I can be put into the right math and English classes , right ?
Excuse me , are you Miss Green ?
I'm sorry . I'm already doing something this Friday .
Of course . I'm not very busy at the moment . If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . I can take you there .
Next month . I think . Are you going to sign up ?
What do you think then ?
Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .
Yes . I am thinking of a tour to Australia .
I ' m renting this apartment out for $ 1050 a month .
I can believe that .
And sorry . I can't find the price . How much is it ?
No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa . Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch !
They sure did .
I have a bone to pick with you .
No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ?
Absolutely . She's a teacher of aerobics .
The food there is pretty good .
I bet . You must be stoked .
Come on ! A little labor , much health .
Wow , this's sinking a hole .
And , is it what you found ?
Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ?
It doesn ' t matter to me .
Oh , Tom ! They sound fantastic . I really like all those things .
The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart !
That's it ! That ' s the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it !
Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I am a stranger here .
Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ?
Of course . When would you like the call ?
Welcome . I could use the help .
It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function .
Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ' t worry about it , it happens to me all the time . I ' m terrible with names too .
All that exercise in a little pool ! Do I have to pay anything ?
Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ?
I will think about it .
Is this Zhang Lin's home ?
I met him through a computer bulletin board .
Fine , I'll be expecting you .
Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English .
I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ' t use their cars as much .
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me .
Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ?
Fine too .
What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ?

Thank you . It's fine .

Why do you want to work in our company ?
$ 79 a night .
I'm going to need to see your ID and $ 27 for your permit .
Good luck to them .
We're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . Do you want to join us ?
I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?
I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight .
My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ?
I know in your resume that you have worked in your present company for 3 years . Can you tell me why you want to leave your present job and join us ?
Since we live in the same neighbourhood , maybe we can help each other from now on .
Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ?
Partly , and he's also a hard working man .
Do you think Mr . Johnson is a good worker ?
At 13:15 .
They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .
I know . But why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ?
I'm sorry Mrs wang , but Mrs Fu is not in at the moment .
There are no countries marked on the map .
Is everything ready for the Christmas party ?
My major is Business Administration , I am especially interested in Marketing .
How do you figure that ?
Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening .
A Mac it is . I'll take one home with me .
And what will you do if you don ' t have enough cash ?
Oh , it's nothing to speak of .
Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ' t you ?
I twisted and turned all night , and couldn ' t sleep . I was worried about my mother ' s health .
Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ?
No , I'm scared of cats .
Are you crazy ?
There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ' s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !
Could you send someone to fix it today ?
Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ?
Pretty well . Everyone is working hard .
Over there .
Great . I got to try so many things for the first time .
I did that .
Because everyone is trying to butter him up .
Uh ... how well do you play ?
I'd like to withdraw some money .
That's wise .
I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget

Wait a minute . I didn't catch you there . Could you repeat that ?
My pleasure .
Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door .
Admittedly , I hope it is a job in line with my specialty . But I will make the best effort to do the job whatever is assigned to me .
Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing .
I don't quite remember . Why did you ask that ?
Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ?
I think it's time you took another dose of each . What would you like to drink with them ?
I see . Which subject did you put last then ?
The advertised rate is based on double occupancy .
Hello , and welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ?
With invoking ? No , thanks .
Yikes ! Temple City .

Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake .

I'd like to have a couple of complete sets of paper money and coins .
I ' m never coming back .
Yes , of course . It seems made to measure .
What are you going to wear ?
What are you getting donations for ?
I know . You just add milk , eggs and a little oil to the baking mix and stir ...
Did you go to Berlin ?
I can call a plumber to fix it right now .
A good choice . I prefer that one myself .
Not on your life ! I'm the best man , so I pay !
I can ' t help that .

I enjoy chicken salads .
25 yuan by air , 13 yuan by sea .
You have so many antiques and Chinese paintings here . May I have a look first ?

Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise .

I'm afraid I can't agree with you .
The doctor has an opening at 10:30 tomorrow . I'll put you down for then .
He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home .
But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing .
What ! I resent that !

I sure can .

Yeah , you're right .
You ' re not nervous ?
I have got a run . Can you tell me where is the restroom ?

I know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy .

Fine , we will cancel it .
Good luck with your life .
